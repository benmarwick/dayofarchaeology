"2","In police procedurals on TV, “driving a desk” is always the worst punishment imposed by the gruff police chief on the maverick detective. Being pulled out of the field and made to fill out paperwork takes the heart out of the job — the protagonist is always trying to find away to get back into active duty. I feel somewhat the same way about archaeology: I was in the field almost every year for nearly the first two decades of my involvement in the discipline, and the last five years or so I’ve spent working on publication projects has left me very restless. I can understand why some field projects never get published — it’s just too tempting to stay out there.So while most of my days recently have been spent writing a book that uses data produced by other archaeologists, and preparing a book that presents the results of my own most recent dig, I thought I’d spend the Day of Archaeology doing a little of the hands-on detective work that I miss. I couldn’t get my hands dirty, alas, but I could at least go digging in some archives. My mission: to find the original of a photograph of a UT Classics classroom taken in the 19-teens or 20s. The archaeological connection lies in the set-up of the classroom, which included a series of 1:1 plaster casts of ancient sculpture purchased from the workshops of August Gerber in Cologne and Caproni in Boston. William Battle, a influential Classics professor who taught at UT between 1893 and 1948, had acquired an extensive collection of such casts for teaching purposes. The collection, mostly intact, is now held by the Blanton Museum at UT Austin, which has been working on an interpretation project for the casts on display. This photo would be included in the interpretive material to explain how the casts were originally used.Photograph of the Classics lecture room in the Old Main building on the UT Austin campus. A series of casts of Classical sculpture are displayed around the room. The photograph is held in the archives of the Briscoe Center for American History at UT Austin. It wasn’t hard to find the photograph, thanks to the organization of the archives of the Briscoe Center for American History at UT Austin. The casts are clearly visible, standing along one wall (the Hermes and Dionysus attributed to Praxiteles, the resting satyr, the portrait statue of Demosthenes, the Venus de Milo) or mounted above (parts of the Parthenon frieze and the Nike balustrade from the Athenian Acropolis). But the photograph, and the larger project to which it is attached, gave me a chance to think about how we communicate information about archaeology, if not about how we gather information.It’s the gathering that’s the sexy part — I am inevitably drawn more toward updates from the field than I am to discussions of publication or data management. But while the collection of information on the ground may form the core of the practice of archaeology, what distinguishes the discipline of archaeology from looting or treasure-hunting is the attempt to represent what we find to audiences who don’t have access to the original material. This is where people who work with material culture spend the bulk of their time. The documentation we collect in the course of excavation or field survey is in service of this goal, as are the published reports and monographs we produce. The interpretation and organization of archaeological evidence is important in this process, but not, I would argue, as important as the representation of the evidence itself (would a pottery report with no illustrations or descriptions be useful to anyone?).We take most of this for granted. What we represent is in large part dictated by disciplinary tradition, which developed in turn in response to the basic needs of the community of practitioners (one records the height and diameter of an intact vessel because other people need that information to compare their material or draw conclusions about the vessel’s function). Discussions of representation focus more on “how” than on “what” or “why”, and this is especially true of the shift toward digital technology. Which is the better representation of a stratigraphic context in an excavation: a page in a site notebook? A computerized database record? A digitized notebook page, plus a database record, plus a plan in GIS or AutoCAD? All of the above, plus 3D? All of the above, but with the record generated only in digital form on a tablet?All these documents are attempting to represent the same thing: a physical feature that has been destroyed, or at least is not present for the reader of the documentation. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the “how” lately, as I prepare the final publication of the excavations I co-directed with Larissa Sedikova in the South Region of the site of Chersonesos in Crimea. Our documentation ranges from scanned notebooks to records in L – P : Archaeology’s ARK database to 3D layers created with photogrammetry and visualized in ESRI’s ArcGIS.Three representations of the same feature (an ambiguous pit): left, a verbal description in a site notebook; center, an ARK database record; right, a 3D pdf showing a model derived from photogrammetry and georeferenced in the site GIS.But working with the history of the cast collection led me today to think about what we choose to represent, and why. These choices are not natural, but very much constructed by culture, and they are not fixed. Early Classical archaeology sprang very much from the rediscovery of Classical art during the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and as a result, the study of Classical archaeology for much of the 19th century was not easy to distinguish from what we now call “art history”. The cast collection at UT was assembled to assist in the teaching of Classical archaeology, which was itself seen as a way to round out students’ understanding of the Classical world from the literary sources. Study of the Classical world was itself seen as a fundamental element of cultural capital in the West at this time, which explains why UT was willing to invest a substantial amount of money in the acquisition of replicas of Classical art.The replication of ancient figural art — intaglio gems as well as sculpture — through physical casting was widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries, as a tool for both teaching and research. A cast collection allowed students to view together objects distributed through dozens of museums and private collections, and it allowed those without the resources to travel to Italy or Greece to see ancient art first-hand (almost). Casts were the internet of their day.But in the mid-20th century, they fell out of favor — they weren’t real art, only copies, and furthermore they had sometimes undergone minor modifications in surface treatment or the patching of missing pieces to make them more aesthetically appealing, so they weren’t even faithful. Many collections were destroyed or dispersed at this point, including the collection of casts at UT: soon after Battle’s death in the mid-1950s, they were sent into long-term storage or handed out around campus as decor for offices and departments. They were “rediscovered” and restored in the 1970s and have been on display as teaching resources since then — but there is no guarantee that the aesthetic tide won’t turn again, since these aren’t technically “works of art”.In this case, a particular way to represent a particular type of archaeological material — Art, with a capital A — fell out of fashion, and then returned to fashion as we became more interested in the reception of Classical antiquity in the early modern period. As it becomes easier and easier to create and disseminate 3D models of objects in museum collections, I wonder where these objects will fit into the story. Like the casts, they’re a way to convey “first-hand” experience of objects to an audience that can’t get to the objects themselves; like the casts, they involve a certain amount of manipulation, invisible to the user, that reduces to some extent the accuracy of the representation. Even better than the casts, they can be created very easily with inexpensive technology, to the point where Sue Alcock’s recent “Archaeology’s Dirty Little Secrets” MOOC had students create their own as part of the course.3D techniques and computational photography provide an exciting new “how” for the representation of archaeological objects. The “what”, however, is dictated to a certain extent by the technology (freestanding objects in the round seem most popular). And the “why”, for now, is partly “because we can!”. It’ll be interesting to see whether digital 3D representations become a standard part of the archaeological toolkit, like photography, or whether there will be a intellectual backlash, as there was with the casts. After all, on a Platonic level, we’re moving ever further from the ideal expression of an object. Will 3D models bring greater access to ancient art and archaeology to the online multitude, as this Google-glass derived printable 3D model of a head of Marcus Aurelius in the Walters Museum suggests? Or is an admittedly cursory 3D effort to model the cast of a Roman copy of a Greek sculpture nothing but an even more indistinct shadow on the wall of the cave?I think some of the most exciting digital work in Classical archaeology that will be done in the next few years will actually involve tracing and visualizing the representation of archaeological monuments and works of art across time. Max Schich is already doing this with representations of Classical monuments in later art, and the Arachne database of the German Archaeological Institute has a contextual browser that allows one to visualize the relations between, say, an intaglio gemstone, a cast of the impression of that gem, an engraving of the cast of the impression of the gem, a textual description of the engraving of the cast of the impression of the gem… Understanding not only how we represent our material, but what we choose to represent and why, may help us understand better our own archaeological practice.The Representing archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"3","Many random bits of heritage end up without a function. This surviving, but moved and rebuilt, fragment of medieval church porch stores a bin, a table tennis table, a pile of chairs and a number of broken lights. I mentioned the porch had been rebuilt this involved an immensely strong cement that is not harder than the flints but is far harder than the soft stone dressings.  It is the stone dressing – the material of primary historic importance – that survive from the medieval building.  You may notice the blackened surface of the soffit of the arch, this is likely to be evidence of the burning of the original, medieval church, or possibly a later fire in one of the bins.Whilst waiting by the porch two people stopped to ask me what it was.  Both were surprised to find it was part of the medieval church.  My meeting was with the Southwark Heritage Association  http://www.southwark.org.uk/ who are looking to attach a blue plaque to the porch and apply for grants to undertake some much needed conservation work.  Part of this application will be to provide a new, more convenient bin store and store for the organisation that use the community building.  So I will be writing a brief for the conservation work so the Association can get quotes for the conservation and investigating ways to secure the building.For much of the day I was discussing a planning application site just to the east of Tower Bridge with the Regional Archaeology Science Advisor, Dr Sylvia Warman.  A small evaluation trench had been dropped in to see if the Bronze Age field systems known from the other side of the street extended into this area.  The trench identified a previously unknown palaeochannel.The Camberwell Parish Church by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"4","Archaeological Research Collective is a non-profit organization based in South Carolina that is dedicated to the preservation of South Carolina’s history and culture through historical archaeology, research, public outreach, and education. We do archaeology on historic period sites which involves everything from consulting clients as to how to manage their cultural resources, research of the historic documents related to sites and projects, archaeological excavations, analyzing artifacts, presentations on our research, and public education programs. So what we do each day changes quite a bit depending on which part of a project we are currently working on.For Day of Archaeology we actually spent the day working on the very beginning of a new project, which will give you an idea of how we start our research. We had an out-of-town meeting with a potential client. We drove a couple of hours out-of-town to a property where they have a known historic plantation from the 18th to 19th centuries. We toured the property while we talked with the client about the history and different parts of the plantation including the houses, work areas, and cemeteries. The client needs to build some new buildings in areas where we know people once lived. We discussed where these buildings would be going and their construction techniques so we can better understand how much they plan on disturbing the site. We also met with students who are doing non-archaeological scientific research there who we are going to be able to work with to get a better understanding of the original landscape of the plantation.From these discussions we can now design a research plan for the site. Anytime you build something or dig into the ground you have the potential to destroy any archaeological record that there may be. So we have to make sure that we have an understanding of how the site was used in the past before they do any construction. We look to see where buildings were, the size of the buildings and how they were built, who may have lived in them, when did they live in them, and what did they do inside and outside of these buildings. Once we have an understanding of these basic questions, and if we don’t find anything that is really important that would require us to do more excavations and research – then it would be safe for them to build the new buildings.We had a great day and look forward to working on this project. Even though we didn’t dig in the ground or find any artifacts we did archaeology all day. We talked about and planned future work, which may be the most important part of archaeology. Without a good plan and questions we would be digging for no reason, which should never be done.

"5","144 days until what I hear you ask? Just the small matter of the public opening of the new Stonehenge visitor centre.If you’ve read my two previous Day of Archaeology posts from 2011 and 2012, you’ll know that this particular project fills all of my work hours, some of my weekend hours and a bit of my sleep. I’m the archaeologist writing, devising and advising on all the content for the new centre. This includes the permanent exhibition, the opening temporary exhibition, the external gallery, the landscape interpretation scheme, the audio tour… whatever we are going to be telling visitors about Stonehenge, I’ll have had some input into it.The entrance to the new visitor centre – a lot of scaffolding and cones at the moment!So what I have been up to today? No surprise that I have been office bound (except for a lunchtime to trip to buy paella from the stalls in Queen Square outside my office – it’s the Bristol harbour festival this weekend) and juggling a few different things:1. E-mails and a phone call about exciting discoveries at Stonehenge this week. Suffice to say that the recent dry weather has been showing up parchmarks beautifully and its been a bit of a scrabble to help get colleagues out on site to survey and photograph them. The last of these e-mails was at 10pm.2. Commenting on my colleague Harriet Attwood’s designer’s drawings for her interactives for the education room – pulling stones, building Stonehenge, cut-away Stonehenge, dig your own barrow, etc.3. Commenting on a new draft reconstruction from artist Peter Lorimer of the late Neolithic settlement at Durrington Walls – a few more trees, more activity and people, slightly zoomed in, and we’re there.4. Commenting on my designer’s drawings of a map of all Grooved Ware findspots in the UK for the permanent exhibition display case – trying to choose which key sites to have photographs of (plumped for Skara Brae, Callanish, Newgrange, Thornborough Henges and Avebury to get a good geographical spread, but might have to double check my thinking on this!)5. Collating and marking up photographs and images for our landscape panel scheme – we’ve been working closely with the National Trust to replace and improve the panel scheme in the Stonehenge landscape and we’re at design stage now, so quite a lot of back and forth about thumbnail maps, photographs, etc. This includes various e-mails back and forth with Nick Snashall, archaeologist at the Trust about panel positions and photo mark-ups – via Blackberry as she is digging at West Kennett avenue today! A large shared Dropbox folder later and our designer has lots to work with.6. E-mails relating to: new photography, audio tour interviews, a request for images from Jane Ellis-Schon who is project curator at Salisbury Museum for their new prehistory gallery, temporary exhibition catalogue layouts, writing for the EH website…The pressure is on. And I’m feeling it!

"6","D’ya know, I should never be surprised anymore?This is the third year of The Day of Archaeology and each year I actually blog on what I do for the day – on that particular day. I don’t explain my work in a museum, explain my past or most recent archaeological research, nor do I blog my perception on what this day is actually about. All I know is  The Day of Archaeology is about our heritage, it is a shared thing world wide, and one that we can all grasp in one way or another. And it is important for various reasons that not need to be explained here.For the last four years I have undertaken a landscape study of a Cistercian Abbey in south east Wales. The abbey has an interesting ‘historical identity’ that is latched onto by some in academia and the public alike. It was small, skint and had no  real impact on its surrounding landscape. It can be waved away with a flutter  of the archaeological hand coupled with a muttering of  ’So what? It is Llantarnam’. It does not help that the grounds of the abbey happened to end up within the boundary of  a post WWII New-town where every thing had to be ‘new’. No watching briefs, no excavations and the general dearth of historical research was sadly wanton. The lack of serious investigation into its archaeological value should be a wake up to us all.Instead of embroiling myself into the political crapness that is archaeology in the Eastern Valley in Torfaen (Gwent or Monmouthshire in old speak), let us have a look at what that particular order is renowned for within their immediate land holdings. It is water management.Now that is boring to a lot of people but there is no need for such disdain. If you follow the systems, you find archaeological remains. It is a simple concept. And I don’t mean walking on banks next to, or along,  leats, streams or rivers either. The world, and his archaeological brother and sister, has done that already. If you want to investigate water systems, the best way to do that is actually get in the systems and walk down (or up) them. It is then, and only then, that you can visibly investigate and find some serious archaeological remains.Last summer was earmarked for the recording of such findings. It didn’t happen due to a few broken and dislocated bones. This year it has happened, and I am quite happy to admit my pleasant surprise at what has been uncovered. What you are about to see is why I have no more surprise while doing this stuff. It is all rather big.You can go from this:-To this:- And that is quite exciting when you consider nothing has been recorded in this particular landscape.For The Day of Archaeology  2013 I looked at this feature which I thought was small (again), much to my incompetent (still) thought. It is a sluice gate within the grounds of Llantarnam Abbey.Again, you can go from this:-To this:-I consider this sort of investigation to be of a semi-invasive nature. Without doubt the remains that are visible are multi-period and only a serious, long term, archaeological investigation will let us all understand the exact nature of the remains. Cistercian water management appears to get a bad press from many areas. There is no need for that whatsoever. When you understand these old systems, it can lead to solving many flooding problems that cause so much heartbreak today. As they are no longer managed, they flood in a considerable manner. This is a school route next to a mismanaged historical water system. .For my last note, I have to point out to everybody the health and safety aspect of this sort of study, it is very dangerous. Many historical water systems are still in use today. Storm water, street drainage and road run off are directed into current systems that had a successful, but managed use, many years ago.You really do not want to get caught up in this sort of stuff.

Meath, Ireland. The focus of the project is the Blackfriary, a 13th Dominican Friary, founded by the Anglo-Norman Geoffrey de Geneville, Lord of Meath in 1267. The friary was quarried out in the 18th century and the remains of are mostly buried. The site, listed as a National Monument in the 1970’s, is situated in a large field and is surrounded by housing. As the town developed, around it, the field fell into disuse and eventual dereliction. The Project is challenged with investigating the archaeological remains of the site, much now underground, and working with the local community to create a space where community and visitors alike can explore heritage and use the site in a mutually beneficial and sustainable way. The Irish Archaeology Field School carries out a summer excavation project at the site annually; this incorporates a practical field programme for archaeology, anthropology and forensic students into the archaeological research project.The Community:Our summer excavation season depends very much on the good relationship the School has with the community; Trim has an active community that are creative, resourceful and proud of their heritage. The School asked members of the community to help out with a contribution for the Day of Archaeology, something that the community themselves would be interested in… Although not perhaps a typical day for archaeologists, the imagination, enthusiasm and fun of this contribution is very typical of the School’s experience of working in this wonderful community.

"8","I’m currently finishing my Honours degree (equivalent of a fourth year for those outside Australia) in Brisbane, Australia. My Day of Archaeology was spent in the classroom, taking a research colloquium course to finish the coursework component of my degree. Luckily for this post, our class today was particularly interesting and gives some insight into where archaeology is positioned as a discipline (in the Australian university system at least).This interdisciplinary colloquium includes students from the four social science disciplines, archaeology, anthropology, sociology and criminology. Over the course of our degrees this is the first course that has brought us all together.  We’re here to learn from each other, discuss our similarities and differences, and ultimately become better researchers. It turns out that even though we are in the one ‘school’ we know so very little about each other, stereotypes abounded in our first class. Archaeologists apparently alternate between looking for treasure and dinosaurs, anthropologists seem to mostly follow Indigenous people around pestering them with questions, sociologists are reportedly obsessed with the philosophy of long dead white men, and criminologists seemingly harbour desires to be Batman. Blatant stereotyping aside, the social sciences are united by a rigorous interest in humanity, a desire to better understand its many nuances and intricacies, and ultimately to contribute our knowledge back to society.Today’s class features a debate over the potential sale of the Persepolis Fortification Tablets in order to pay off a debt that Iran was judged to owe the victims of the 1997 Hamas bombing in Jerusalem (this is a serious and intensely political case on which you can read more about here). This debate brought up serious questions about cultural heritage, its role in the creation of identity, value in an irreplaceable source of information on the past, and whether items of cultural heritage should be exempt from treatment as ‘assets’.Clay Tablet, Persepolis Museum, Iran. Image by Pentocelo via WikimediaWhat I found most interesting about this debate were the different perspectives that we all had on this one case. Whilst we all recognised the importance of the tablets and emphasised the global nature of cultural heritage, each discipline had a different focus. The sociologists were most interested in aspects of power and control, criminologists over the legality of the case and the commodification of heritage objects, the anthropologists were concerned with the issue of state control over material culture and the intertwining of cultures, and the archaeologists focused on the preservation of cultural heritage and the integrity of these priceless collections.It seems unfortunate that this is the first time we have been united in our degrees as it is so clear that we have much to learn from our fellow social science disciplines. There is a tendency to put on blinkers and not see the valuable contributions and perspectives that others have on your own discipline. I’m not sure if any of the archaeology students were quite prepared for the unique criminological or sociological take on what you’d assume was a straight archaeological case. As an archaeology student one of the most important takeaways of this day has been the importance of being interdisciplinary and the value of being open to other perspectives.Off now to rid the streets of crime…The What would Batman think about the Persepolis Fortification Tablets?

"9"," Hello!Hello, All. I am happy to participate again in the third annual Day of Archaeology (2011, 2012).  Congratulations and a big THANK YOU to all of the other participants and volunteers!  The past few years have been a wonderful experience – I love seeing what other archaeologists are doing around the globe, as well as sharing my own work.My name is Molly Swords and I am an historical archaeologist based out of Moscow, Idaho, and employed as a Cultural Resource Specialist III for SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA).  For the last few years, we have been processing on an enormous archaeological collection for the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD).  This project has also led to a new partnership with the University of Idaho as I teach both Applied Cultural Resource Management and Issues in Heritage Management classes.In keeping with my two previous day of archaeology posts- I’ve chosen to document what my day looked like today…Kali D.V. Oliver and Theodore Charles, graduate students at the University of IdahoThis morning, I had a lovely start to my day. I met two University of Idaho graduate students for an early morning coffee meeting.  We talked about progress on their thesis topics, upcoming conferences where they could present their work, and options to consider as avenues for archaeological publishing.I dedicated a good portion of my morning and afternoon to editing a couple of technical reports and organizing artifacts for a museum exhibit.  The company that I work for, SWCA is putting together a museum exhibit at the Bonner Country Historical Museum on the Sandpoint Archaeological Project with the support of ITD.  This exhibit is a fantastic way to illustrate this amazing project to the local community and visitors to Sandpoint.  The museum exhibit should be open in mid-August; so, make sure to check it out if you are in the Lake Pend d’Oreille area!At lunchtime, I decided to call Mary Anne Davis, the Associate State Archaeologist for the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). I wanted to check in with Mary Anne Davis about details for students presenting and the possibility of having a University of Idaho session at the Idaho Heritage Conference (September 25-27). Go Vandals!  This year is Idaho’s territorial sesquicentennial (the 150th anniversary of Lincoln’s signing of the congressional act creating the Idaho Territory). In celebration of this anniversary, folks and organizations around the state have been hosting events, including a very impressive Idaho Archaeological Month in May, and will continue to observe the sesquicentennial with the first ever Idaho Heritage Conference.  This conference is a partnership between of a number of organizations in Idaho (Idaho Archaeological Society, Idaho Heritage Trust, Idaho Association of Museums, Idaho State Historical Society, National Trust for Historic Preservation, and Preservation Idaho), all of which will hold their annual meetings, preservations, training, and field trips together for this conference. Mary Anne and I also discussed having something similar to the Day of Archaeology during Idaho Archaeology Month next year.AACC Stacks of Reference ResourcesAACC Comparative Collection          The last part of my day was spent at the Asian American Comparative Collection (AACC), housed at the Alfred W. Bower’s Laboratory of Anthropology at the University of Idaho.  I am doing some research on Overseas Chinese for a publication that I am currently writing.  If you do not know about the AACC yet, a volunteer coordinator and one of my archaeological heroes, Dr. Priscilla Wegars, runs it.  The collection houses around 27,500 entries in the database covering artifacts, documents, bibliography, and images.  This collection is such a wealth of information and Priscilla is such a treasure.  I wanted to spend some time going through the stacks of resources, including dissertations, theses, and gray literature, to help me shed more light on the Overseas Chinese in the American West.  In the span of 40 minutes, Priscilla provided me eleven amazing documents.  (Honestly, with Priscilla’s help it took about 10 minutes).  When I told Priscilla that I was going to “blog” about my day of archaeology and ending up at the archives she said that I was “excavating the archives.”AACC Food Storage Jars, typically referred Ginger Jars** I have included the link for the Asian American Comparative Collection Foundation at the University of Idaho, they are currently accepting donations in order to keep this world-renowned and heavily utilized collection available in the future**http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/aacc/FUTURE.HTMAll in all, it was a lovely Day of Archaeology.  If you want to follow me on twitter- for more archaeological tidbits- I’m anthrogirly.AACC houses a variety of cultural materials including those from China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands (including Australia and New Zealand) Here are some links:http://www.swca.com/index.php/http://idahoarchaeology.org/projects/sandcreekarchaeology/http://www.preservationidaho.org/heritageconferencehttp://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/aacc/People that I would like to thank: SWCA, Mary Anne Davis, Priscilla Wegars, Kali D.V.

"10","More times than not, the life of an archaeological collection will outlive the lives of the archaeologists who originally excavated it, but what happens in the “golden years” of the collection? Like people, a collection’s condition in later years depends the care it receives from its “family and friends.” With proper care and attention to detail throughout generations of archaeologists, a collection can continue to add pieces to the puzzle of our human history.Archaeologists, including University of Idaho (UI) students, curate and research collections at the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology in Moscow (a small town in Northwest United States). The Lab is the main repository for Northern Idaho anthropological and archaeological collections and documents as well as an arena of applied research for the University. Students, faculty, staff, and volunteers care for, store, rehabilitate, document, and provide access to prehistoric and historic artifacts, their associated documentation, ethnographical works, and a host of references and research resources.On this day in July, Lab folks continue to rehabilitate several collections in addition to a host of other daily and ongoing tasks. This post is a collaborative effort by many of us who had an archaeological sort of day.Front cover of the field journal that turned Leah’s day around.There is good to be found amidst the wreck and ruin:Leah K. Evans-JankeCollections Manager, ArchaeologicalAlfred W. Bowers Laboratory of AnthropologyOn days like these I really wonder why I became an archaeologist.  I have been running from project to project trying to stay ahead the workload destined to land on my desk.  It seems everywhere I look there is a responsibility begging for my attention and each one is equally important.  Today I am actively working on two NAGPRA inventories, curating documents from a collection excavated over 40 years ago, planning a large scale exhibit and creating an activity booklet, trying to write a grant, finding ways to boost our Facebook audience, and a bunch of other stuff.  I am waiting for someone to say “you are an archaeologist/collections manager – why aren’t you working with artifacts?” but this is the reality of archaeology. I might be able to get back to artifacts in a month or two, but a lot of being an archaeologist in our modern world comes down to paperwork, administration/budget management, and fretting endlessly about making sure employees have jobs for this moment and into the future.  The reason I fell in love with this job is rarely part of what I do on a day-to-day basis.   For those of us who learned to trade in our hiking boots for cubicles, there are moments when we remember what drove us into this career and the spark reignites.  For example, I included a picture of one of the documents I am curating today because the front cover not only made me laugh, it reminded me that I am an essential link between “then”, “now”, and “someday”.  Time passes all too quickly and before we realize it, we become part of the “then” and our experiences, although small and largely insignificant, build into this thing collectively known as the human experience.  As I am reviewing field note books, I am seeing one of Idaho’s oldest and best known archaeological assemblages through youthful eyes, straining to see the past for the first time.  It can be some pretty powerful stuff – if you let it grab you.  It can be powerful enough to take you out of your cubicle and into that wonderful time known as “then”.The view from Alyssa’s desk. Alyssa Schoeffler GriffithLaboratory TechnicianI am an undergraduate at the University of Idaho with a major in Anthropology.  I am lucky enough to work at the “Bowers Lab,” “Bowers,” as we know it.  On any given day you can find me processing archaeological collections for curation, scanning archaeological documents for archival purposes and entering data into a database.  On this particular day, I am surrounded by archival-grade, grey storage boxes stacked all over my desk.  They contain the last 54 bags of artifacts to be processed from a collection our lab has been intermittently working on curating for the last decade or so.  While not glamorous, my job today entails giving each of these bags an individual bag and box number and entering it into the collection’s Access database.  Doing this allows artifacts to be easily located once they have been shelved in the repository as well as making it easier to create box and bag labels that are generated using said database.Courtney BergeLaboratory TechnicianAs a volunteer in the lab throughout the summer, I have been privileged to watch as the rehabilitation of a 40 years old collection moves towards completion. A few weeks ago the lab started cataloguing the final year of this collection, which was excavated from the late 1960s-early 1970s. We have been working on dividing all the artifacts into their proper categories, assigning them new catalogue numbers, and entering their new numbers into the database. Today, I am work to ensure that every artifact has a permanent label. These coded labels contain their catalogue numbers, a site number that tells us in which site the artifact was found, as well as the number of artifacts in a bag, and what type of artifact it is. These labels are extremely important because they allow us to be able to identify the artifact easily and quickly. Making labels may not seem like the most fun thing to do in archaeology, but it is important. It is exciting to know that in a few weeks we will be finished working on this collection and that it will be ready to be used by someone in the future.The view from Amy’s desk. Amy JohnsonLaboratory TechnicianCurating collection from Florence, Idaho (10-IH-1923)Chi-Namel powder varnish can recovered from historic Florence, ID.Florence, Idaho, was a historic mining town established at the onset of the Idaho Territory (1863), and the  site I am curating dates to the early 1890s. Florence was was one of the most productive placer gold mines in the state and mining continued when quartz substituted gold as the sought after resource after the gold had been depleted. Few people resided in the town year-round due to harsh winters and the town was completely abandoned in the 1950s. This site had a prominent Chinese population, as did most mining sites in the Northwest United States. The site was excavated in 1993 and the curation is taking place this year. The collection is associated with a single home, likely inhabited by family of European descent. Among the artifacts that I have rediscovered in this collection include a can of table varnish entitled Chi-Namel. The can has not been opened and still contains the powder varnish. Advertising that was found while researching the artifacts depicts a racist representation of Asian Americans cleaning and varnishing wooden surfaces while a white middle class woman sits and relaxes in a chair. This sort of bigoted advertising was unfortunately common in turn-of-the-century America. Though remote, the town did have a prominent Asian American population involved in operating the mines.Amber ZielgerLaboratory TechnicianThe view from Amber’s desk.An undergrad in cultural anthropology, I work as a lab tech for the Lab.  For the last several weeks, we’ve been curating a pre-contact collection excavated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. My role in the curation has largely been one of data entry, but since we’re on the very tail end of the project, I’ve moved on to curating the documents for the collection. Today, that means scanning thousands of pages of catalog sheets, saving them as PDF files, and double-checking to make sure each sheet scanned properly.When I first started working at the lab, I expected archaeology to be much like what one sees in films and on TV. I thought anthropology labs were mostly built of stainless steel, and that we might wheel skeletons out of hidden closets for comparative reasons. Few of my expectations were fulfilled, but as it turns out, I prefer it that way. The work I perform is often tedious, but it makes me proud to know that we’re contributing to a wider understanding of humanity’s history (often one flake of débitage or catalog sheet at a time.)Note: We’d like to extend a special thanks to all the folks who entrust archaeological collections to the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology and the constant support we receive from the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Idaho. The The Archaeological Backstretch by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"11","Happy Day of Archaeology! Take a moment today and think about the imprint you will leave in the ground when you’re gone! As a trained osteologist and physical anthropologist, I am familiar with bones, graves, and the grave goods our loved ones leave for us when we’re departed. I have participated in many traditional digs because, as archaeologists, we all love to uncover the past.However, my current work with the Center for Digital Archaeology (CoDA) at UC Berkeley is anything but traditional. As Informatics Specialist I work with our CTO and Founder Michael Ashley to develop hand crafted, microbrewed, mobile, and field friendly database solutions to harmonize and collect all archaeological data directly from the dig site. This is done through our remarkable Codifi database, a mobile database solution run on iOS and Windows and implemented on iPads in the field. We have deployed our Codifi solution at many sites around the world, and I feel strongly that I am contributing not only to the growth of the field of archaeology but also making archaeologists’ work easier and more intuitive.The work I do now is primarily about content and media. Storing, managing, adding and preserving metadata, relating, and presenting to a user. Archaeologists love content, as we should, our work is dedicated to its discovery and understanding. I’m glad that the work I do is enabling archaeologists to more easily create, manage, and relate their content as they find it. I enjoy being connected to digs in Turkey, Jordan, and throughout the Middle East, and empowering not only the data collecting process, but also the knowledge gathered from it to inform cultural heritage.An example of one of these fantastic projects: Last House on the Hill (LHOTH) brings together incredibly rich digital media with all of the archaeological data to company the 600+ page physical monograph into a single, but multi-vocal accounting of the UC Berkeley excavations at Çatalhöyük, Turkey. Explorers of LHOTH will find they can easily traverse what would otherwise be an unwieldy amount of content. Ruth Tringham, the project director and the Creative Director@CoDA, has poured thousands and thousands of hours into LHOTH, finding deep satisfaction in bringing this remarkable resource to life.The Hand Crafted, Microbrewed, Mobile, and Field Friendly Database Solutions– Tyler Wilson by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"12","I work as a GIS Specialist in Tucson, AZ for a company that does, among other things, cultural resource management. I started as an archaeologist, but I received my masters in GIS a couple years ago because I like using tech to increase efficiency and transitioning archaeology into an increasingly digital world. I like the challenge and I like that I get to be a part of every project on every level. From proposal, to field work, to report I get to see everything. I also get to manage the GIS server and make web applications. I research new technology and attend webinars to keep my skills up. I am the only GIS professional in the company so there are days where I’m very overwhelmed by the workload. Sometimes I get very little accomplished and sometimes I can make hundreds of maps in a day.Today I worked on 4 archaeological projects. Three of these projects are in Northern New Mexico and have recently concluded their field sessions. The first one was in Santa Fe where some of our sub contractors monitored a busy intersection getting a utilities upgrade. I made 3 project location maps and 2 site plan view maps. The second project was on tribal land to the north east. It is also getting a utility upgrade but in this case it was walking survey. I made 3 project location maps for this one and 5 site plan maps. The third was across North Central New Mexico and I downloaded field data from our Trimble and post processes corrected the data. The correction wasn’t going well because the Trimble was not catching enough signal for correction. I’ll figure that out on Monday.The last project I worked on is a resurrected data recovery project originating in 2003. This project has been brought to life several times in the last decade. Three weeks ago they approached me and said that they needed every figure from every year brought into the current software and edited. As I have gone through the data I started keeping a list of mapping specialists who worked on the project. I’m up to 7 not including me, so to say that it was frustrating bringing together all of those styles is an understatement. But we keep on and I was able to finish the plan views yesterday. I turned them over yesterday and started today on the profiles. Those should go better since there was not a lot depth for the features of these sites.After that I worked for about an hour on my time card for the the week. This is a moderate week. Some weeks I have 20+ projects to enter. Beats unemployment by a long shot though.The Every Map Ever by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"13","It is hard to believe another year has passed, and it is time for a third year of Day of Archaeology participation. What is the radiocarbon plus/minus on a year?Joking aside, I am both excited to have more archaeology-based work in my planner now, and to be part of this across-the-globe initiative.  After all, archaeology is still a living, breathing passion and field for all of us. What better task is there than showing others around the world what archaeology is, its methodological practices, and what its true values and other gains are for the world in which we live?This summer finds me teaching cultural anthropology online, catching up on professional journal reading, working on book reviews for a professional archaeology journal, listening to insightful webinars on national archaeology funding and legislative news, and even conferencing with a K-12 (secondary school) teacher on her plans to integrate archaeology lessons into a classroom this fall.It was and always will be fun to collaborate on lesson planning and discussing what I have facilitated as a volunteer.  Archaeology lends itself well to active learning engagement, hands-on activities, and interdisciplinary learning. It allows for flexible, creative planning no matter how young or how senior the audience. Sharing how I took paint color chips to construct a pseudo-Munsell chart on the cheap, to how to construct mock dig boxes, to what online resources are out there on historical archaeology etc. was a lot of fun. I was grateful for that opportunity earlier this week.Knowing that these lessons ignite the passion in other students as young as I was when I first proclaimed I want to be an archaeologist (by kindergarten or first grade, 5 or 6 years old) and even their K-12 teachers is exciting too.Admittedly, equally enjoyable higher education tasks (such as grading, facilitating a meeting, engaging in online dialogue with students, and tutoring) largely filled my day today.  After all, it is that time for the summertime juggle of roles and responsibilities.  However, I did spend some break time engaging in the online archaeology literature (thanks in part to social media resources aggregating my favorite archaeology news, professional organization, magazine and journal websites for me!).By day’s end, my efficiency reduced my workload to the point that I can spend all day Saturday reading the end of an archaeology book and writing reviews.  In retrospect, I am content to have carved out a life sustaining my passions for what we each do. After all, my writing about archaeology and living the life of an archaeologist is not exclusive to one day a year or to one set of job descriptors/job titles. I might not be as active in laboratory, research or even field-based lines of archaeology at present, but what I do as an educator merges my passions of teaching and archaeology.  This increases sustainability of the discipline to some level, as new people find their passions and interests in what I do, continuing dialogue of what archaeology is and what it can contribute to the world in which we live.The At the Inner Core: Passions for Archaeology and Education by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"14","On this day of archaeology, I find myself not doing much archaeology.  The kind amongst you would say I’m on maternity leave.  The reality is that I’m unemployed.Over a year ago, I completed my PhD in the Near Eastern Neolithic at the University of Liverpool and moved back home to Canada.  As I was unable to find an academic job, I have spent the year publishing articles from my thesis, and being a mom.Today, on the day of archaeology, I have spent most of the day running around after my 3.5 year old, and my 5 month old.  We have been swimming, played ‘pretend’ and generally done everything and anything.  When my husband gets home from work, he entertains the kids, and I escape to the ‘closet office’, where I can work for an hour undisturbed.Working undisturbedI wish I were in the field with many of my colleagues, but the reality is that it is hard for mother’s to make it to field seasons sustainably.  It takes so much time and resources to organise childcare that I was unable to go to Boncuklu Höyük, Turkey this year. Maybe next year!Toddler with a Konya plain Kangal sheepdogIn the meantime, I work to publish my research.  I examined the physical reality of occupying a series of structures found at a number of Near Eastern Neolithic sites.  These structures do not appear to be houses, and are often much larger the other structures, and have unusual features.  The most famous of these are the pillared buildings at Göbekli Tepe, and the tower at Jericho.  I examined these structures to determine how they may have been used and how they might have mitigated problems that were emerging in the Neolithic as people settled in more permanent villages.Someday, I hope someone will pay me to do research and take my children into the field.  Until then, I will play Dr. Mom for a bit longer, and hope that someday soon I can become a professional archaeologist in realityDr. Alexis McBrideThe Academic Archaeology with Kids by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"15","Today, I’m working at the Western Washington University archaeology lab, but since I wrote about that for Day of Digital Humanities a few months ago, I thought instead I’d write about the work I do with my company where I create software and tutorials for archaeologists.9-12pm Worked through a Database TutorialThis morning I finished up working through the tutorial for FileMaker Pro 12, a database management system (DBMS). I’ve heard great things about Filemaker from other archaeologists who have used it to create custom databases for recording archaeological sites. Compared to some other DBMS, Filemaker’s interface is very simple, and the program has some nice features, like tight integration and easy portability for iOS devices (e.g. iPhones, iPods, iPads) through the FileMaker Go app. This past year, I attended two conferences where several archaeologists demonstrated the Filemaker databases they built for academic projects. In particular, the Center for Digital Archaeology built their impressive Codifi app using FileMaker. Although I’ve yet to hear of any CRM companies who use Filemaker, I think it should work as a short term solution for a friend of mine to use this summer on field projects. In fact, I built a simple relational database for archaeological survey this morning based on the Intermountain Antiquities Computer System (IMACS) and Filemaker made it pretty simple for me to transfer the database to an iPad.Although Filemaker seems great so far, I’m hesitant to rely on the whims of two different companies, Filemaker and Apple, to ensure that I will be able to access my data when I need it. I interned briefly at Digital Antiquity (the organization that runs the Digital Archaeological Record data repository) and know that archaeologists who trusted their data to propriety database systems regretted it later when the database companies went under, leaving archaeologists with datasets that were difficult to access on new computers that couldn’t run the older database software. If the archaeologists were cautious, they might have translated their databases into less flexible but more stable preservation file formats, like plain-text comma separated value (CSV) files, but in many cases that didn’t happen.  Because of that experience, I always try to ask myself “how can I get data back out of here?” whenever I use a new piece of software.For the past few months, I’ve also been building a custom archaeology data recording application for mobile devices using the Adobe Cordova/Phonegap framework.Screens from our data recording application.The Phonegap framework allows me to use web languages like HTML, CSS, and javascript to create mobile applications that will run on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, and webOS. I’m already familiar with these coding languages from building websites and I like the idea of being as platform agnostic as possible. As an added plus, if my partner and I decide to make the application open-source, other archaeologists will be able to edit and customize the code more easily than if we wrote the app in C or Java. Phonegap and HTML5 do have their limitations though, so in case we run into issues that slow our app down too much to make it useful, we’re also looking into porting the app to native code. For now though, Phonegap allows us to quickly prototype the application using languages we’re familiar with.1-3pm Videoconference with Chris at DigTech  I’m working on the PhoneGap application with Chris Webster of DigTech, LLC. Chris is a long-time shovelbum, project manager, and podcaster who recently started his own cultural resource management (CRM) archaeology company. Chris wants to do as much of his site recording digitally as possible in order to increase efficiency and data accuracy, spend less of his clients’ money, and free up his archaeologists’ time to do more research, analysis, and publication rather than data-entry. Chris has accomplished a lot of this by using various off-the-shelf applications like Tapforms and MementoDatabase, but decided that none of them were doing everything he wanted or needed to do for CRM archaeology.Chris and I meet weekly to discuss projects and to collaborate on the application. Chris primarily works on the interface design: making sure that the app is useful in field situations, with large enough buttons, text, and easy access to vital data. I primarily handle the coding and database design, but Chris and I have also been challenging each other to learn more about computer programming as we go. Simply designing a database to hold archaeological data has forced us to carefully consider and try to anticipate the different needs an archaeologist might have for a database in the field: if sites can contain features and artifacts, but features can also contain artifacts, how do you map that relationship? How many controlled terms for material types do you need to offer to standardize and streamline recording without limiting an archaeologist’s ability to add in an unexpected material type? Others have put much more thought into this area, but the end goal is to design databases that are specific enough to increase efficiency and accuracy while being general enough to compare data across sites, archaeologists, and regions. For Chris and I though, it’s been useful mental exercise to think about these kinds of problems as we program.Recently the app has started to resemble something that would be useful out in the field, but we still have a lot of work to do. Some of the field situations we need to adapt our app to handle are to expand beyond simple survey to being able to quickly and efficiently record rock art. We have a database up and working in the app and have tested recording coordinates using the mobile device’s internal GPS (it’s nowhere near submeter accuracy, but it’s still handy), but we’d also like to add in some other features, like simple mapping, storing photographs, and making the data exporting work more easily.3-4pm Wrote an email to a programmer to collect bids on fleshing out the application.Because neither Chris nor I are professional programmers, we’re contacting several people who are to see what they might charge to help us add features. We’re not sure yet whether we’ll fund that ourselves, release a beta version to fund further development, or seek funding through a crowdfunding website like Kickstarter. If you’re an experienced programmer, we’d love to talk to you. You can contact us through our websites or at russell[at]diachronicdesign.com or chriswebster[at]digtech-llc.com4-6pm Geeked out with other archaeologists over a new toyA few other archaeologists and I have been eagerly awaiting a low-cost tablet with both an internal GPS and a >3mp camera that we can use for field recording. Today, Google announced the new version of their Nexus 7 tablet which met our requirements. I’ve been waiting awhile for that right combination of specs, so I bit the bullet and bought one. I’m really excited the Nexus 7 runs on android 4.3, which means I can finally run the FAIMS application on a real device; up until now I’ve had to emulate a Nexus 7 on my laptop, which is not ideal. From their website: “The Federated Archaeological Information Management System (FAIMS) Project is funded by the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) program[…] an Australian Government program to build new infrastructure for Australian researchers.” The researchers at the University of New South Wales and elsewhere have specifically designed for CRM data collection in Australia. I’ve been interested in the FAIMS project since speaking with Dr. Sobotkova at the 2012 SAA meeting in Sacramento and was very impressed when Dr. Crook showed me the progress they made when I saw FAIMS’s booth at the 2013 SAA meeting in Honolulu. The FAIMS project has open-sourced their app, which I love, and a friend and I want to customize the app for an excavation project here in the United States. Now that I will have a new android device, I can finally move forward with playing with the app and (hopefully) pay things back by contributing some code or tutorials back to the project.If you couldn’t tell already, I’m generally pretty hopeful that technologies like databases, mobile devices, internet blogs, and social networks can help archaeologists record, analyze, and publish about archaeological sites more quickly, sustainability, and openly.  I’m excited about all the other posts I’ve seen on Day of Archaeology today that involved everyone from academic archaeologists to CRM archaeologists, community members, students, authors, and more. I hope this post has been interesting and helped add to the diversity of the voices on this blog. I’m looking forward to reading more posts and can’t wait until Day of Archaeology comes back around next year.Cheers!RussellThe Building an Archaeology Data Recording App by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"16","Can you guess what it is yet?There are at least 7 dead emperors, 3 dead kings, 2 dead queens, some dead generals, and one wonderdog following me on Twitter.This is an occupational hazard, when you put ‘digital archaeologist’ on your business card. Any day of archaeology for me involves standing up at my standing desk, pounding the keyboard in frustration as something that should work, at least in theory, does not. But what on earth do I do? Here’s the quick version:Archaeology generates incredible volumes of information. A lot of that information is in fact information about the information.  The description of the relationship between two contexts? The description of a subgroup of contexts? The spatial and chronological patterns? When the excavation is over, all we’ve got are our records. What I’m working on right now are ways of mining that data (and especially its metadata) for new insights. I’ve recently come back from the world digital humanities shindig, #DH2013 in Lincoln Nebraska. There was an entire session devoted to digital archaeology there; I presented a paper called ‘topic modeling space and time‘.Topic modeling is a technique that uncovers patterns in unstructured text. It’s a kind of unsupervised clustering routine. Tell the computer, ‘go find me 15 topics in this data, and tell me the relative percentages of each topic in each context record’. This lets me see patterns in the ways the archaeologists themselves worked with the original data whilst excavating.Very meta. I don’t do much field work any more; hard to do much Roman stuff when I’m here in the Ottawa Valley. But I think I’m finding ways of pulling out meaningful patterns from old excavation notes. You can see – and hear – for yourself where I’m going with all of this at the website for our session. One of the things that is coming out, though there is some disagreement amongst those with whom I’ve shared these thoughts, is the voice of the individual excavators again. The final monograph, the final site report, is always written in a kind of vanilla pablum-esque-ese (to coin a word) that glosses over all of the personalities and social factors that go into that great cauldron, the excavation project (especially the academic ones). I’d like to figure out ways of returning some of the subjective bits back into things.That’s what this digital archaeologist has been working on, on this day of archaeology, when there was a down moment. Next week, I gear up for back-to-school in September. I’ve got two classes to write more-or-less from scratch. One, ‘Roman Archaeology for Historians’, will have a significant open access portion to it – feel free to drop in, or ping me for more details.The Put down that trowel and pass me the mouse: on digital archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The MIRA system will work atop the Mukurtu CMS platform, linking to the iVEC supercomputer in Perth to archive FORM’s massive amounts of spectacular images and video, and to give access back to the aboriginal communities who contributed to their makingHi I’m Kelley! Today started like many days, with a big cup of coffee and Twitter…As both a social media intern and an image content specialist here at CoDA, I start my daily routine by perusing the latest news and discoveries in Archaeology and set them to post on our Twitter. Today was pretty easy since it’s the Day of Archaeology, but my favorite days are when CoDA has blog posts or trips or other announcements pertaining to our projects. After working at home for a couple of hours, I made the trek across Berkeley to 2224 Piedmont, home to the CoDA treehouse! In the land of image processing, I am working with the FORM team to create and prepare metadata to be embedded in their impressive array of over 20,000 images of the Canning Stock Route (CSR) project, from 2007 to present day. Processing this many images is no small feat, however it is important and rewarding to work on such an important archive! I look forward to seeing the completed MIRA database which – along with CoDA’s other products – will be a fantastically visual and meaningful web of images and video linked by keywords and tags. We hope the database will only expand and become more enriched over time. Aboriginal community members will have access to this digital collection of their artwork and traditions; they will be able to add more information through MIRA and and download high-resolution images of their projects and history.-Terra-I often find myself in a conversation that goes somewhat like:“So Terra, where are you working these days?”“I work at CoDA, the Center for Digital Archaeology over at UC Berkeley”“Oh… what does that mean?”Well… like Kelley, I am a content specialist, but while Kelley handles most of the images, I am mainly responsible for video content. My degree is in cultural and visual anthropology but I have always been passionate about archaeology. At CoDA I am able to incorporate my love for visual media and my interest in archaeology. Currently, as a part of our project with FORM, I am working with more than 2.5 terabytes of video. Today I am sorting through and compiling as much information as possible to add as metadata for each of the video items. This will allow easy and efficient searches in the Mukurtu platform and aid in organizing content. The video and images from FORM that we are working on are an incredible look at the Canning Stock Route Project. I am inspired to work hard to build a meaningful archive for aboriginal communities in Western Australia and their future generations. The So You Think You’re a Content Specialist… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"19","As Head of Intervention and Analysis, I manage a number of that provide expert advice on archaeology to English Heritage, commissioning and carrying out research in support of the organisation’s aims and objectives as set out in the National Heritage Protection Plan. This year’s Day of Archaeology saw me heading to London to take part in a meeting of the Scientific Dating team.I’ll skip the train commute into London – I did that in my 2011 piece, and it wasn’t that interesting then.We gathered at 10am in the Wroxeter Room in EH’s headquarters building at Waterhouse Square in Holborn.Team Dating: Cathy Tyers, Alex Bayliss, Peter Marshall, Kate Cullen, Shahina FaridThe purpose of the meeting was to review progress across the full range of the team’s activities and projects, to look at issues arising from the team’s work, and to try to resolve the pressures that arise in a small team with a heavy workload. Much of the meeting focused on the two main commissioning budgets, for radiocarbon dating and tree-ring dating, covering progress on commissioned work and progress on completing reports. While much of the work goes on to appear in monographs and journal articles, most of the work is also disseminated through the English Heritage Research Reports series – the database of reports can be searched at http://research.english-heritage.org.uk/ (try searching using the keywords radiocarbon dating or dendrochronology).Commissioned research can include work on English Heritage historic properties, designation casework, archaeological and characterisation projects. The team also becomes involved in specialist research arising from this work, including Bayesian analysis and wiggle-matching, and new guidelines are currently being drafted for radiocarbon dating. This work can involve working closely with European colleagues, for example in developing chronologies that will help us to date softwood timbers, much of this timber having been imported to England from Baltic states. The largest current European collaboration is The Times of Their Lives, a project jointly run by Cardiff University and English Heritage that won  €2.5m of European Research Council funding to develop a new dating framework for the Neolithic period: http://totl.eu/project-introduction/. This builds on earlier ground-breaking work on the Neolithic in Britain and Ireland (Whittle, Healy and Bayliss, 2011 Gathering Time: Dating the Early Neolithic Enclosures of Southern Britain and Ireland). This is an important and ambitious programme of research, and involves frequent travel to coordinate research across Europe, from Serbia to Scotland. It is also, of course, a demanding programme of work and travel, and quite a lot of discussion at our meeting was devoted to trying to resolve some of the programming difficulties arising from juggling this and other commitments. Too much (unpaid) overtime is being incurred, and we will have to defer some work to try to bring working hours back to within reasonable limits.Serious discussion requires serious fuel: iced bun time.My role, apart from listening to and taking part in the discussions, was also to update the team on developments elsewhere in Intervention and Analysis team and in our Department, Heritage Protection. The biggest development is, of course, the recent decision to split the organisation into two parts – a new charity, retaining the English Heritage name, to manage the historic properties, and a new service under the working name of National Heritage Protection Service, which will advise government on historic environment issues including heritage protection and designation. This change will have to be implemented by April 2015, by which time we will also have to absorb a further 10% cut to our grant-in-aid from government. There’s not much I can say about this beyond recent press statements and briefings from our Chief Executive, but coming on top of the major reorganisation following on from the last Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010, a further period of uncertainty is inevitable. I also had to update the team on our Division’s response to last year’s staff survey and on developments with the Reports Series. There was also some discussion over our IT, but I’ll draw a veil over that….We also took the opportunity to celebrate success. Since the last team meeting, another in volume in the series of Radiocarbon Datelists has been published covering the years 1988-93. This can be bought or downloaded as a PDF from http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/radiocarbon-dates-1988-93/.Alex Bayliss and Kate Cullen celebrate the latest Radiocarbon Datelist. The next notable event will be the publication later this year of another major book, on the dating of Anglo-Saxon graves: Bayliss, A, Hines, J, Høilund Nielsen, K, McCormac, F G, and Scull, C, (forthcoming) Anglo-Saxon Graves and Grave Goods of the Sixth and Seventh Centuries AD: A Chronological Framework.The meeting wound up by 3pm – my thanks to the team for wide-ranging and stimulating discussions, interrupted only occasionally by the need to explain complicated stuff to me. Thanks also for the tea and cakes.After this I popped upstairs to see Richard Lea of the Properties Research team; we’ve been working together with another colleague, Nicola Stacey, on coordinating a programme of research on one of our historic properties, Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire. This work has included a substantial programme of tree-ring dating coordinated by Cathy Tyers, and has resulted in new dates for a number of surviving roof and floor structures within this partially-roofed monument. We’ve recently received a revised report on the analysis of parts of the building by Wessex Archaeology, and we’ll be reading that with keen interest next week.I also dropped in to see my manager John Cattell, and also caught up with another senior manager, Barney Sloane, before catching the bus to Waterloo and heading home. There to sit in the garden with my other half, the cat and a large gin and tonic to contemplate writing this blog.Frankly the cat appears at the special request of Lorna Richardson.The A date with Team Dating by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"20","Students Natalie and Shaun. Source: Benjamin SkolnikIn the 1995 film Pulp Fiction, the characters chase after a briefcase, the contents of which are never shown on screen. Instead, when the characters open the case to peer inside, the camera captures their awed faces from the case’s perspective, bathed in an otherworldly glow (a very similar effect to how we photographed our field school students on our last day in the field). The audience never discovers what is inside, but it is understood to be so important that it drives the plot and momentum of the story. Director Quentin Tarintino has said that anything could be in the case, whatever the viewer can imagine. For every audience member, it will be different. In story-telling, the use of the briefcase in the film is a device is called a MacGuffin, and it stands for an object that motivates the characters to move the plot along its trajectory. To use a more archaeologically-themed fiction, the MacGuffin is the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail.Students Sabrina and Aleks. Source: Benjamin SkolnikI explain all of that in order to ask this: When we tell our stories in archaeology, especially to the public, how do we use the artifacts?The artifacts are our discoveries, and that is what drives us as archaeologists. It is what sells our stories to the public. It’s hard to ignore that the sense of discovery provides the attraction and romance to archaeology, particularly in popular media (see Shanks and Tilley 1992). Even the publicity poster for the Day of Archaeology 2013 invites others to “discover the past.” As I sit in the Archaeology in Annapolis lab today, working on the site report for our field work, my main concern has been how to present our discoveries without reducing them to a plot device.Students Norma, Katie, and Isobel. Source: Benjamin SkolnikThe past three years, Archaeology in Annapolis at the University of Maryland, College Park, has been excavating at the Wye House Plantation on the Eastern Shore. In 2010, fellow PhD student Benjamin Skolnik discovered the locations of two slave quarters that would have housed a portion of the hundreds of enslaved on the property before Emancipation and the buildings’ destruction in the early twentieth century. We discovered them again, in the form of their remains when we excavated that summer, defining the boundaries of the structures as best we could. We returned from our third field season earlier this month, and our jobs are currently in the lab, processing the discoveries.I mean processing in a few different ways. As I sit here in the lab today, a volunteer student Lisa is washing and rebagging the artifacts from Wye House. She carefully scrubs the glass, ceramics, bones, and nails with a toothbrush and separates them into categories. Each bag of artifacts corresponds to a context from the field, its location in vertical and horizontal space. She’s learning to identify the type or style of ceramics—which helps us determine the date of each deposit—but only occasionally needs confirmation of her identification skills. Lisa is processing the artifacts and the information that is going to aid in our research. She’s discovering that right now.Students Audrey, Ian, and Angie. Source: Benjamin SkolnikWhile Lisa works, I’ve been sitting at one of the lab computers, digitizing a drawing of our most thought-provoking discovery this year. When we opened up our units this summer, and instructed our field school students in how to excavate them, we told them what we expected to find. Still, the unopened unit is a source of untapped potential; like the briefcase, anything could be under the dirt, whatever the archaeologist can imagine. For every excavator, it will be different. We chose to place two side-by-side 5 x 5 ft. units in front of where we suspected the doorway of one living quarter to be. We hoped to find continuing evidence of West African spiritual practices.Outside the doorway to a slave quarter attached to the Greenhouse on the same property, there was what is known as a spirit bundle or cache. They consist of assemblages of found and re-purposed objects that are part of a tradition that can be traced back to religious practices in West Africa. Material culturalists have found themes in African art such as motion, containment, and flash manifesting in wheels, bottles, mirrors, and boundaries (see Thompson 1984). In caches, they often include white objects, blue glass bottles, iron nails or other forms of metal. These objects are the vessels of sympathetic magic, which understands certain materials to possess power over the spiritual and natural worlds. What we found went beyond what we imagined, and we’re still unsure of what we’ve discovered. We still need to process.The exposed surface of the assemblage. Source: Archaeology in AnnapolisSeveral round, flat artifacts lay on a horizontal axis in the two units, just inside where the quarter would have been and underneath the raised floor. There were the bases of blue bottles, one crushed, but many still intact. There was a spoked iron wheel and flattened metal cans. One area contained white objects. When we saw these things together, knowing why we were digging under the doorway in the first place, we stopped. Two field school students, Norma and Katie, measured and mapped the assemblage and we sent photographs to experts. Dr. Robin Poynor at the University of Florida advised us over e-mail, and we tucked our discovery away until next year, when we’ll hopefully better know how to proceed. Combined with deposits of iron farming implements we uncovered last year, these objects may be a shrine or alter to Ogun, a deity of iron and the forge. One piece of a bottle is molded in a way that divides it into four quarters, possibly invoking a crossroads or cosmogram. Now I’m tracing the drawing on the computer so that we can clean the image, highlight particular aspects, and make sense of what we’ve found.An in-progress digital illustration of the assemblage. Drawn by Norma and Kate, digitized by Beth PruittWhen did we discover the cache? Was it when we first noticed a number of round objects lying flat? Am I discovering it while I digitize my students’ drawing? Until we learn more, I don’t know that we have discovered it yet. The powerful sense of discovery that thrives in archaeology runs the risk of turning the artifacts into MacGuffins, the driving reason in the plot of our story. Discoveries draw in public attention and media, but they don’t tell much about archaeology and the process of learning what the artifacts mean after we leave the field. Like any other trope, the MacGuffin is a device that can be used to great effect, and as a graduate student with an interest in public archaeology, I’m still uneasily struggling with how to do it.The discovery is not the artifact. Discovering is not a moment of finding the artifact. Discovery is an ongoing process of conversations and interactions that take the artifact from an object to a symbol. We could have easily seen bottle bases, pieces of iron, white ceramics, and taken them as unrelated scatter. By seeing if they fit together, we’re chasing a story where these artifacts are representative of a resistive religion that proliferated in the African Diaspora during slavery and beyond. That is the discovery, not the objects.We might have discovered the two slave quarters three years ago, but we have rediscovered them every year since, and we continue to do so.Archaeology in Annapolis maintains a blog, where you can learn more about Wye House and our excavations. If you can help us with our discovery and understanding of this assemblage, please let us know!ResourcesShanks, Michael, and Christopher Y Tilley1992   Re-constructing Archaeology: Theory and Practice.

"22","Recently, I’ve begun analyzing data for my dissertation project in historical archaeology.  My day is spent in the lab, surrounded by animal bones, small tools for detailed cleaning and measuring, spreadsheets, and more bones.  I’m interested in brothel household food practices, and animal remains from kitchen trash deposits are a good place to start.  As a zooarchaeologist I’m often asked about my lab process, especially about the kinds of things can I learn from studying animal bones and how I know what they are.  When I’m embarking on a new project I often ask myself the same kinds of questions.  How do I identify animal remains?  What categories are important to my basic research questions?  Does any of this actually matter?As a point of reference, I’ve been starting with the same tongue-in-cheek query I’ve been asking myself since my first solo project: Who ate the hamsteak?  Broken down into basic parts, what I’m really posing is an answer to why zooarchaeology matters.  ”Ate” implies an action, a human behavior.  ”Who” implies a search for the identity of the eaters.  The “hamsteak” is what is left over for the archaeologist to find, a clue to discovering cultural identity.  Examining eating habits is a way for me to understand not only past diets, but delve into meaningful choices that indicate ethnicity, class consciousness, fashion, heritage, nutrition, and many other aspects of humanity.Choosing categories in which to record data that might show patterns in food choices usually begins with a broad understanding of what is in that pile of bones sitting on my table.  Species, skeletal element, and age are necessary no matter what the project is about.  Published guides about bones with detailed drawings, measurements, and age charts are available for archaeologists, but the best way to identify animal remains is by comparison to complete zoological specimens.Since my focus is on food, I also collect data on how the meat was prepared, including butchery marks, if the bone has been burned, and other human modifications.  Butchery marks can be very obvious, such as the relatively neat lines and even surface an industrial saw makes, or they can be difficult to distinguish, such as scratches from utensils during consumption.  Burning has more ambiguous meaning – for example, it can indicate food preparation or it can indicate how the remains were disposed.  Sometimes you can see that a bone was broken or smashed intentionally in preparation to recover the marrow inside for use as an ingredient.Finally, and perhaps more importantly, I determine the cut of meat from butcher charts.  Knowing the cut links a bone to specific recipes, serving methods, pricing, and food trends, all of which can be researched historically.  Analyzing food remains doesn’t end in the lab.  I spend a lot of time pouring over regional and historic cookbooks for popular dishes and personal records for family favorites.  Newspapers with restaurant and grocery advertisements, personal accounts, and food columns are also helpful in deciphering what I am looking at in that big pile of bones.The Leftovers (Archaeology and Food!) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"23","Watercolour by Thomas Marsh of a pavement from Newton St. LoeA museum archaeologist’s life is perhaps one of the most challenging and varied of all. Take today – I had a pretty good idea of what was in store (no pun intended) but as usual there were a few more challenges than I expected!I like to start early – generally before the phone starts to ring – but I guess that there weren’t too many other archaeologists who started their day shopping for pillows. I needed to acquire these in preparation for putting back together one of our largest archaeological jigsaw puzzles, the Orpheus mosaic from Newton St. Loe.The Roman villa at Newton St. Loe was discovered during the construction of the Bristol to Bath section of Brunel’s Great Western Railway in 1837.Several mosaic floors were found at the villa including one which illustrated the story of Orpheus, a mythical poet and musician, charming a circle of wild animals. The mosaic was lifted and re-laid at Keynsham Railway Station where it remained until 1851 when it was given to the Bristol Institution (a forerunner of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery). Repeated moves between various stores over the next 150 years left the floor highly fragmented and at one time it was even thought to have been lost.Brunel had wanted to create a museum for all the material found during the construction of the Great Western Railway. This led to a trainee civil engineer, Thomas Edward Milles Marsh (1818-1907) being given the task of recording the villa before its destruction. He prepared accurate plans including a life size tracing of the Orpheus mosaic and was responsible for lifting this floor and another for display. Although not involved in further archaeological work, Marsh retained his records and these were eventually donated to Bristol Museum by his daughter in 1936.When Marsh transferred the mosaic to Keynsham it was in good condition. However evidence suggests that when it was moved again it may have been lifted with a pick-axe. Further breaks then occurred because of poor packaging and moves between stores, as well as frost and fire-damage. This led to the floor being broken into several thousand pieces and presents a major challenge in terms of its reconstruction, conservation and storage.Marsh made careful records of the villa including this oneA full-scale reconstruction of the floor was discounted for many years because of its poor condition. In 1992 members of the Association for the Study and Preservation of Roman Mosaics (ASPROM) began the painstaking job of identifying its fragments. It was finally pieced together, in public, in the front hall of the museum between July and December, 2000. The reconstruction enabled us to make improvements to its storage to make it more easily accessible for conservation, research and display.So what do my pillows have to do with the mosaic? Well as I am also working on a British Museum touring exhibition – “Roman Empire:Power & People”- we have decided to display some of our own amazing Roman collections in other places around the museum. Orpheus needed to be returned from the underworld, which in this case was the museum basement. Thankfully in the 13 years the mosaic has been stored away we have installed a bigger and better lift, which made the task of moving it up two floors so much easier than ever before. So what did it take? Four strong men, two curators, a pallet truck and some good old fashioned elbow-grease. Oh yes and two pillows which I’ll need to kneel on as I shuffle all of the fragments back together next week.Steve looks on whilst the two Ians wonder if they have the right piece in the right place.Now if the excitement of moving the mosaic wasn’t enough, today I have also been editing object labels for the BM touring exhibition (we are leading on all the design and interpretation), shortlisting for the Future Curators Programme (we are hosting a post in 2014) and preparing for our contribution to the Festival of Archaeology at our very own villa site – Kings Weston Roman Villa tomorrow. I have also been proofreading a new guide to the site that we will be evaluating tomorrow with the work-experience students who have been with us all week.Funnily enough the day finished pretty much as it started, although instead of pillows I was shopping for Basil, Lavender, charcoal, broccoli and compost…which amazingly are all items we need for the activities we’ll be running out at the villa tomorrow. Clearly a museum archaeologist’s job description probably never includes shopping but it is inevitable since thinking on your feet and having a creative mind invariably requires new resources – even if they aren’t always the obvious archaeological kind!Re enactors at Kings Weston Roman Villa 2013The Museums, Mosaics and More by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"24","My day of archaeology has been a gentle, desk-bound one, but nevertheless I’ve dug up at least one conundrum.I’m going to be carrying out a small investigation of an industrial site, one that until recently had been producing pottery for 200-odd years. We’ve had to make sure that the area we will be excavating doesn’t contain any hazardous material, and have been given the all-clear in a corner of the site after a series of boreholes have been drilled and analysed. However, my work today has revealed that where we plan to be excavating may be crossed by or is certainly close to the route of the vanished-without-trace (mostly) Newcastle Under Lyme Canal, a singularly unsuccessful venture that was abandoned and filled in in the 1930s. Since the canal passed through much urban industry, I’d guess that it was filled with anything and everything that came conveniently to hand. Photographs and maps show mostly open space, with a couple of short-lived buildings, alongside this stretch of the canal. Some of the area had been used as a clay pit, itself long since filled in. A short tramway appears on some early maps, heading into this open space, perhaps either being used to move clay into the works or rubbish out. So, this amount of airy conjecture means that I have to find out more detail. More recent photographs show the area used as a car park. Perhaps if we did happen upon the remains of the canal it might be interesting. There again it might be a damp depression crammed with old bricks, which would be depressing!The other investigation I touched on today focusses on a WW2 US Army base in Staffordshire that was used after the war to house displaced Polish families. It was capable of housing over 6,000 troops, and later a so-far unknown number of Polish refugees, the last of whom left in 1963. About a dozen buildings survive at least in part out of approximately 140 structures. The surviving structures are reinforced-concrete-framed prefabricated buildings with asbestos cement roofing and brick infilling, a few of which have served as agricultural stores and animal shelters. Others survive only as foundations and concrete slabs. Today I’ve been drawing a small scale plan, mostly so that I can work on a methodology for dealing with the extant buildings. I did however find my first reference to US Army units being sent there on their way to fight in the DDay invasion and the Battle of the Bulge.Both these projects will involve archaeology and art, a fascinating and exciting combination. They have to combine the rigour of archaeological practice with the emotional and creative input and output of artists. A good way to spend the day of archaeology. The You never know… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"25","Our offices at The Center for Digital Antiquity (DA) are located on the fourth floor of Hayden Library, on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus.  The library is being renovated and this morning we were evacuated from our offices during the third fire alarm (drill?) of the week!   While we waited outside—enjoying rare Arizona cloud cover –I thought about what I’d write about today.  My job is totally different than the dirt archaeology I was trained in or the academic anthropology track I envisioned myself on when I started out as an undergraduate about 15 years ago, but I love it! I’ve decided to describe a bit about what we do in our small office generally, and then highlight a few of the specific activities we participated in today.The Center for Digital Antiquity is responsible for maintaining and improving the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR), an online repository for digital archaeological information.  We specialize in providing long-term access to and the preservation of irreplaceable archaeological files.  tDAR accepts a wide range or archaeological information—field notes, reports, manuscripts, photographs, sketches, drawings, 3D scans, databases, charts, tables, and more—from around the world.  We keep them safe, associated with rich and archaeologically specific metadata to ensure that they can be discovered, and, as needed, migrate the files to new formats so that they will be usable today and long into the future.  Our mission is to ensure that the information collected as part of archaeological research, impossible to replicate and often generated at great cost (financial, as well as the literal blood, sweat, and tears of field archaeologists!) is available for researchers of today and the future.After I finally made it back to my desk, I spent the morning reviewing and putting final touches on the first draft of a grant proposal seeking funds to develop an archival solution for a group of US government archaeologists who work for different agencies in the same geographic region but have a difficult time sharing important archaeological information across agency firewalls.  They each are responsible for archaeological and historical resources within their respective management boundaries, which rarely coincide with relevant archaeological boundaries, and need an efficient way to access the work that has been done nearby to contextualize current and future work.  As it stands now, archaeological work that has already been completed is difficult to find and incorporate into background studies—not knowing about an important report, or knowing about it but not being able to track it down is as bad as losing it to a flood or fire.   Using tDAR we hope to create a large repository for regional archaeological information to drastically improve efficient discovery and use of previous archaeological research in the region.  The metadata associated with all these records in tDAR will be searchable by anyone, so researchers from anywhere will be able to discover the records related to this region’s archaeology.Next, I worked with DA’s Executive Director Frank McManamon on developing a means of publicizing the recent addition to tDAR of an important and very large set of digital images of Mimbres pottery vessels (mainly from archaeological sites dating to about a thousand years ago in the Mimbres River valley in western New Mexcio).  For more on this check out a recent news release published by ASU News:  https://asunews.asu.edu/20130716_mimpidd.I spent about an hour mid-day planning and organizing meetings for next week to discuss various proposals we have out with clients who are interested in using tDAR.I will spend the rest of my day reviewing a large Access database that inventories physical and digital collections at the Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory (MAC Lab).  We are working with the MAC Lab to organize and archive their digital archaeological information related to collections they maintain from work carried out by the Department of Defense.Meanwhile, other DA staff members were busy working on updating and revising sections of the policies and procedures related to tDAR.  Some of the new policy sections were approved at a Board of Directors meeting earlier this week and will begin to be used and made available on parts of the tDAR website soon.  Others will be edited using the comments made during the meeting and sent back to our Repository Oversight Committee for further consideration and revision.Also today, one of our Digital Curators downloaded a large data set relating to Cold War era archaeology and cultural resource documentation at Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida from a CRM firm’s FTP site.  This data set, along with documents and images related to the archaeological resources and history of the Range, are being added to tDAR to make the data and information (if they are not determined to be “confidential”) more easily and widely available and to preserve them for future uses.  Next, our Digital Curator working on the Avon Park project began creating metadata records for the data set and other digital files from the Range and upload the files into tDAR.  After that US Air Force archaeologists and CRM officials will review the metadata and uploaded files before they are made “live” and available in tDAR.So that’s what we’ve been up to!  Please stop by and visit tdar.org/news/ any time learn more about what’s going on out our way, and tdar.org to search our extensive archive of archaeological information!The A Day at The Center for Digital Antiquity by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"26","I’m having a bit of a late start going today as I am finishing up a paper I am writing for a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) archaeology class that was offered by Brown University.With that said, I am Cayla, 28 years old, mother of five and recently married. I am from Southern California and an undergraduate student of anthropology with concentration in archaeology.I started as an undergraduate at a local college in 2006 but do to life happening, I had to step away until recently. I thought I was too old to go back to get my BA but that is not true! I do not have the option of going on campus all the time so I applied to two universities that offered a BA in Anthropology via distance learning. I have all general requirements met except for three, so I am not sitting too bad at the moment! If you have that drive, passion and determination to make your dreams happen, go for it and do not let your age stop you!One of my mentors told us the first time I ever went into the field, “You will either love it or you will hate it.” And this holds very true! Most that signed up for the field, did not come back after our first time out. It was cold and windy…the type of wind that cuts right through you…and the hike up to the site was quite long. It was rough but despite being frozen, I loved it! My first site was pretty dull but it was still good for learning.The second site I was on, was on a wildlife preserve that was once inhabited by local Native Americans. The site itself was pretty rough in the sense that there was a lot of bushes and the overall area was quite large. We did mostly surface survey and found pottery shards which we GPSed, did the paperwork on, labeled the bags and bagged the artifacts. Right before we left one day, we were standing around discussing something and I happened to look over…that is when I found what we later identified as human bone. It was thrilling!In my time as a student, I have learned so much. I love the field and I love being behind the scenes in the museum, cataloging and sorting through artifacts. I have a long way to go but I plan to carry it out no matter what it takes.Remember, if you still have it in you, age aside, to follow your dreams, whatever they may be, go after it!The Never Too Late by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"27","I spend the greater part of my archaeological life digging up and studying parts of the world with which I have very little personal connection. Most of my commercial work concerns London (see my 2011 DoA post) and sometimes it concerns Brazil (my 2012 DoA post was from Brazil). But this years fair Day of Archaeology dawns to find me in the village where I grew up. Along with an eclectic team of archaeologists, farmers, designers, architects and others we are “popping up” a museum… right here on Hayling Island. Hayling Island Pop-Up Museum, is an event for the CBA’s Festival of Archaeology.A view of HIPUM as proposed. Sketch by Carsten Jungfer.As I cycled up to the Museum site at the farm tea room this morning I was filled with a strange sense of satisfaction to be doing something that will directly relate to the place that I’m “from”. In many ways this place is idyllic, it is a lovely place to be working and it is a pure pleasure to be here. Today, I’ve helped build display cases, make signs, make ice-cream, discussed display layouts, designed a visitor handout, I rode to town to fetch postcards from the printers, I edited the captions on a video. Almost all of these things I’ve done as only one volunteer amongst many.Danger! Red paint.I was always dimly aware of the Iron Age-Roman-Saxon temple that lies in the fields not half a mile west of the little Norman church in the village. Perhaps it was an unremembered visit to the dig here in 1978 (aged 2) that set my mind towards archaeology; gave me my instinctive desire to “do” archaeology; an enjoyment of all that special patina of finds bags, permatrace, planning frames and muddy anoraks that form the special fabric of (British) archaeology.Coming back to Hayling years later and setting this project in motion has been like writing a love letter to the village and to the special site on our doorstep. It has also been a way to engage with and show appreciation for the archaeologists who dug the site here in the 1970s, to get to know them and to find out more about the site, the way they dug it and what it was like for them to do the dig.Making a museum is a curious thing. Certainly it is about “public” although I’m not sure if I know what I mean by that or who I mean by that. It is certainly about creating an experience, trying to inspire or evoke some feeling in the visitor that they have experienced the site in some way as well as having learned something more concrete about it. For me is also about shining a reflected light on the way archaeology and heritage are about memory, connection and place.Most of all this project has been about what can be done with very little money and very much good will and hard work. HIPUM will exist for one weekend only, we launch tomorrow the 27th July and close on the 28th of July 2013.

"28","Today’s only anomalyIt’s now 10pm on the Friday night of the Day of Archaeology in Ireland…. and I’m just about finished for the week. I’ll be called away to get packing for a very brief holiday soon – so in this window of opportunity I’ll post this short entry. In previous years I’ve had the luxury of time to put together a cogent entry, but this evening I’m just about to kick back and relax, so forgive the brevity.I run a very small commercial archaeology consultancy in the west of Ireland, at peak employing 18 people full time and a cohort of contractors. We’ve been reduced to three full time and two contractors today. This has created its own problems – we have the legacy of a bigger company, with a solid IT infrastructure but we’ve lost some very experienced staff.Earlier today Charles posted on  ‘Picking up the pieces’ after the collapse of the Celtic Tiger and the problems of emigration, the resultant loss of knowledge and experience and the impact of economic failure on the cultural heritage sector, and it’s something that has affected us as well.One element of that is that my role has become far busier – at one time I had the luxury of keeping up a consistent blog for the company, and was focussed on marketing and management – now that there’s only two full time archaeologists (me and Bill) and an ecologist (Ger), the job runs from accounting to assessment to  being out on site testing and monitoring, with a great deal of travel throughout Ireland, long days and long distances.I started (very) early  this morning on a field survey in the East of Ireland  but was able to get back to the office by lunch. The survey was part of a large EIS for an infrastructure project and involved visiting farms to establish whether aerial anomalies were of archaeological potential or could be otherwise explained. One inspection was all that was required today. Didn’t find anything! Back in office the weeks notes had to be written up – smartphones are a lowercase godsend – all my field notes are voice recorded, my photographs are geolocated, I have a suite of maps on dropbox on the phone and just have to come back and transcribe the voice recordings (also georeferenced), upload the photos to Google Earth and remember to save everything in the right place. Paperless… That’s the aim.Later, it’s time to complete the final draft of an EIS for a proposed gas pipeline which involves most of the afternoon working on GIS measuring distances and editing the text. A little bit of CAD work on another project brings me to dinnertime – This is something I thoroughly enjoy. I started in archaeology as a site illustrator and always enjoyed that role, doing the occasional digitisation and prettifying of site drawings these days is something I find hugely relaxing for some reason – maybe it’s all the nice colours and shades you can play with, or the uncomplicated nature of it.. I don’t know, it’s late and I’m tired.Then – the dreaded invoicing, accounting and chasing money… less said about that the better.And finally the day is rounded off with preparing a fee proposal. That takes me until 9… Bit of cleaning and packing and here we are, Worthingtons Red Shield and me.

"29","Day of Archaeology 2013 fell on a special day for me. As an Outreach Assistant for the Florida Public Archaeology Network Northeast Regional Center (FPAN-NERC), I’ve worked with a volunteer cemetery group throughout the summer and today served as another organized cemetery clean-up. Oaklynn, an African American cemetery, rests in Edgewater, Florida. Like many cemeteries throughout the nation, Oaklynn (and those who have dedicated themselves to this project) face significant obstacles resulting from disuse as well as the neglect that often follows. Documents show that the cemetery was in use between the 1920s through the 1970s as an African American site.Evidence of vast andalism is pervasive at Oaklynn CemeteryUnfortunately, the story of the cemetery and those resting within its boundaries is largely incomplete. Fortunately, the cemetery group dedicates much of their time to research which continually renews their passion and interest in this project. Could there be something to make this project better? YES! Descendants of those buried in Oaklynn work with people not associated with the cemetery in any manner. The volunteer cadre spans across generations, races, affiliations to the cemetery, sexes, et cetera; it represents a true community project and a moving shared experience. (Hence the reason I’m delighted and honored to share a bit of our day with you).Other than clearing debris, what can an archaeologist do in a cemetery? I’m not a bioarchaeologist, so I’m definitely not excavating burials! My role on site is to help guide the volunteers as they clear the site. I recommend where they work, ways to interact with the site (I think of it as cemetery etiquette), answer questions about removing debris (whether natural or man-made), take notes about our activities and new features discovered in the cemetery, and assist in any manner the group might need me. Similar to other archaeological sites, cemeteries demand meticulous care and thoughtful consideration.Trudi and Linda diligently clearing a small part of the 6 acre cemeteryCemeteries serve as outdoor museums, monuments to the past. Although we can enjoy them in the present, its good to remember that such places represent sacred spaces in which real people of the past rest. Embracing these ideas helps to shape how archaeologists interact with a site. At Oaklynn, I carefully consider the impact an action might have on the cemetery (e.g. What might happen if we cut this tree down? What might happen if we remove this large root from the ground?) and continuously evaluate the context of objects and materials found during the cleaning (e.g. Should we dispose of these bricks or are they related to a surrounding burial? Is this spittoon related to a burial?).Today I was an archaeologist. Today I was a community project participant. Today I was a proud observer of the past and present blending. Today I had appreciated hard work, camaraderie, and a bit of fun!Formula for a good start to cemetery clean-ups: ice cold water and a smooth wheelbarrow rideA wonderful group of volunteers, including descendants, community members, and FPANnersThe Preserving Sacred Spaces: Community Clean-Up at Oaklynn Cemetery by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"30","Antes de ingressar no grupo de pesquisa e ser bolsista na área da arqueologia, aconteceu um episódio no mínimo interessante. Soube através de um amigo de classe que havia um anúncio, ao qual estava nos murais da Univille. Objetivo era realizar um “intercâmbio” entre alunos da Biologia Marinha junto ao Museu Arqueológico de Sambaqui de Joinville. Desde então começou meu contato com a prof. Dra. Dione da Rocha Bandeira. Entre uma ida e outra no museu, desenvolver algumas leituras, ver como é realizado a triagem do material faunístico, etc.; não obtivemos sucesso na proposta de “intercâmbio”.Mantive contato com a prof. Dione sobre uma possível bolsa em um projeto que estava para sair. Depois de em encher a caixa de email da Dione com questionamentos, como “Olá prof.ª saiu alguma coisa do projeto?”, nos reunimos no MASJ e concretizamos minha participação no projeto ATLAS. Iniciou-se assim minha participação nas atividades arqueológicas. Leitura de diagnósticos arqueológicos da região da Baía da Babitonga (São Francisco do Sul, Itapoá, Garuva, Barra do Sul, Joinville, Araquari); quadro comparativo dos sítios pesquisados por Piazza (1966, 1974), Rohr (1984), Martin et al. (1988) e Bigarella et al. (1954), apresentação dos trabalhos, reuniões, etc. No ano de 2012 estive vinculado ao projeto Ilha da Rita com o subprojeto “A fauna do sambaqui Ilha da Rita – inferências sobre hábitos pré-coloniais na alimentação”. Vinha trabalhando em cima de um flotador, e hoje está concluído.Hoje estou trabalhando com o material faunístico do Sambaqui Cubatão I, já pré-curados, terminando a triagem do ano da escavação de 2009. O Sambaqui, objeto deste projeto, localiza-se na margem direita do Rio Cubatão, em Joinville/SC, próximo à sua foz no Canal do Palmital. Este sítio foi parcialmente destruído pela retirada de material para aterro de estradas. Atualmente, o sítio vem sofrendo processo erosivo em sua face nordeste decorrente de ação flúvio-marinha intensificada por atividades antrópicas, como trânsito de embarcações e retificação do rio. Resultando em um perfil de aproximadamente 10m de altura por 80m de comprimento. A erosão tem evidenciado a existência de artefatos de fibras vegetais e madeiras nas camadas inferiores do sítio, aspectos de grande interesse.Foto aérea do Sambaqui Cubatão I, mostrando a equipe de escavaçãoImagem de detalhe da escavação do Sambaqui Cubatão I, realizada pelo Museu Arqueológico de Sambaqui de Joinville (MASJ) em parceria com o Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia da USP (MAE-USP), a Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública da FIOCRUZ e o CNRS/FrançaAs análises arqueológicas no Cubatão I identificaram além dos sepultamentos, artefatos de rocha e concha e os seguintes tipos de ecofatos: ossos de fauna, carvões, rochas e conchas de bivalves e gastrópodes.  Até o momento o projeto está em andamento, mas seguem algumas fotosInicialmente entrei no curso de Biologia Marinha com a ideia de trabalhar com Aquicultura. Entrar no projeto de arqueologia foi uma oportunidade de conhecer uma área diferente e totalmente nova para mim. Aos poucos fui aprendendo a gostar cada vez mais desta ciência.Hoje o que me impulsiona é a pouca expressão de biólogos trabalhando com a arqueologia; o clima agradável de trabalho, propiciado pelos amigos de grupo de pesquisa; e principalmente a oportunidade que me foi dada, juntamente com o crescente interesse.The Início de estudos em arqueologia na minha vida acadêmica by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"31","Connor Rowe, Center for Digital Archaeology, Mukurtu CMS. Today is the Day of Archaeology, in which archaeologists around the world blog about this day in the life of an archaeologist. Now my background is in cultural anthropology and digital media, but I happen to work with a team of archaeologists at the Center for Digital Archaeology here at UC Berkeley, so I tend to jump on the archaeological wagon, especially when it intersects with the digital world. Hence my participation in #DayofArch 2013.Browsing through digital heritage inside Mukurtu CMS.My current project is Mukurtu CMS, an open-source digital archive originally intended for (and created by) indigenous communities to collect and share their (digital, digitized, and intangible) cultural heritage, on their own terms. It is built on Drupal 7, and attempts to remain community-based in its development process (yes, this is as hard as it sounds). We’ve been supported by generous NEH, IMLS, and university grants, which help us, first, eat, and, second, continue this project for little or no cost to interested communities (notwithstanding Congressional budget cuts…). These grants have allowed us to produce complementary tools, e.g., Mukurtu Mobile, an iOS (and soon, Android) app, and work on projects as varied as museum exhibits and school science curricula. My work consists primarily of community support, software and installation upkeep, and facilitation of internal and external communication. I also get to fly around the continents and help communities implement digital preservation workflows on site.Pondering bugs in the TreehouseToday, however, I am in our sunny Berkeley treehouse office, listening to the quiet chirping of birds, leaf blowers, and jack hammers (the archaeological offices surround BP’s new capital investment), staring at lines of code trying, somewhat successfully, to fix a problem reported by a community using Mukurtu in New Zealand. Time zones make it a little difficult to collaborate in real time, but it adds to the sense that the work I’m doing is globally worthwhile. My work in this aspect of digital archaeology, what might be termed digital cultural heritage preservation and management, is a rewarding niche of archaeological work. It allows me to empower others in the face of expectations of steep digital learning curves, manage their own heritage, and make sure that history is not lost, but rather shared. It allows me to build and learn code, while also paying attention to cultural relevancy. There is responsibility tied to certain knowledge, sacred stories, and ancestors. By building, maintaining, and supporting Mukurtu, I help communities retain control over how their heritage is distributed.

"32","With the beautiful Hawaiian sun shining and the prospect of visiting amazing pre-contact sites all at my fingertips, I find myself doing the un-sexy but truly important “office archaeology”. As a State archaeologist, I am doing what is very important, review and compliance. I take this seriously. It may not be the most sexy and exciting or appealing thing about doing archaeology here in Hawaii, but with this position comes huge responsibility. So while some of my colleagues may be out in the beautiful Hawaii landscapes, I find myself reading through a 1200 page archaeological inventory survey for an amazing piece of land, highly significant to our native culture here in Hawaii. Being Native Hawaiian myself, I see my position as being an important cog in the wheel of responsible development and progress. So I guess as I participate in the 2013 Day of Archaeology… I may not be doing fieldwork, but I am contributing to the field of archaeology in Hawaii by ensuring that I do my part in protecting my cultural heritage, the heritage of our State our Nation and our World… one report at a time!  The My Day in Archaeology in Hawaii by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"33","I’m sitting in sunny California, in the Classics Library at University of California, Berkeley, and I’m thinking about sunny Italy. For 5 years (2006-2010) I spent Julys living in a Boy Scout camp in Sgurgola, Italy, about an hour south of Rome, field-directing the excavations of Villamagna. [See more about our project here: http://www.villa-magna.org]. And for the past three years I have spent Julys working on the material we excavated, working on the stratigraphy and working with finds specialists who were studying the pottery, glass, animal bones, environmental remains, coins, small finds and the human remains from the cemetery. This summer we are finishing the manuscript. I can tell you a bit about where we are for medieval Villamagna and what I’m doing today, and then I’ll tell you about my other project, which I’m working on in my spare time: urban gardens in medieval Italy.DIGGING (AND WRITING) VILLAMAGNAOur project at Villamagna looked at a site over time. In the Roman period, one of the 2nd-century emperors (Hadrian, probably) built a large country house, surrounded by vineyards and forests for hunting. The buildings of that villa are still visible in some places on the site, and what was clear even before we started digging was that throughout the middle ages people had lived among the Roman ruins–the church on the site was built and rebuilt several times in the middle ages reusing Roman bricks, columns and other pieces, and we knew there was a monastery in the area from some medieval parchment documents at the Cathedral archive. Digging was great fun. We had a super team of people from Italy, America, Britain, Belgium, Algeria, Sweden, Canada; these ranged from local high school kids to a volunteer excavator who could excavate a skeleton in minutes, perfectly (it took me hours, imperfectly). The results were very exciting. We could see an early medieval phase of occupation, with high-status pottery, in the Roman building. The monastery buildings were there, including the cloister and a huge underground cistern (a storage container for water). We found a huge cemetery in front of the church, dating mostly from the late middle ages, with hundreds of skeletons; it is now the largest excavated medieval cemetery in Italy.At the moment, I am working with a research assistant here at Berkeley and the other editors of the project, Lisa Fentress and Marco Maiuro, to pull together the work of the entire team into a publication which makes sense of the thousands and thousands of pieces of data we have collected. Let me give you an example:A riding spur found at VillamagnaThis is O 700, a spur which came from SU 4291 (we called contexts stratigraphic units, SUs). This was a deposit of rubble and silty soil which accumulated in the well house of the monastery cloister.This is page for SU 4291 on the database ARK, an open source online recording system, which L – P Archaeology custom fit to our project, and which stores all of our archaeological data. http://ark.lparchaeology.com/ Giorgio Rascaglia tells me that the pottery from this deposit dates to the latter half of the fourteenth century, and this fits with what the stratigraphy suggests about the abandonment of the monastic buildings and their conversion to an elite residence next to the church, and also what some medieval parchments record. A bull of Pope Boniface VIII from 1297 suppressed the monastery of Villamagna and gave its properties to the bishop of Anagni, and then in the 14th century, various bishops argued with one local family, the Caetani–perhaps the most powerful family in medieval Central Italy–over their occupation of the property. The Caetani, or some of their homines (their men), were probably the ones living in these buildings and stabling their horses nearby. We found four other spurs from this period (our Finds specialist, Tyler Franconi, tells me that spurs like this, with a rowell, were common from the 14th century onwards) in this and related deposits, as well as a pair of bone dice for when the knights were playing games, and lots of broken drinking glasses, which Barbara Lepri has studied (these are her drawings):Barbara Lepri’s depiction of fragments of medieval drinking glasses found at the siteThe final publication will include a website, based on ARK, with the records of our Objects, Pottery, Glass, single-context stratigraphy, as well as a printed volume with essays by Giorgio, Tyler, Barbara, and myself on this material. Today, we have been editing the footnotes and checking the bibliographic formats for essays on early medieval liturgical sculpture and ninth-century pottery and revising maps of the area from the Roman and medieval periods [thank goodness for http://pleiades.stoa.org/].URBAN GARDENING IN MEDIEVAL ITALYAs I have been in the Bay Area, I’ve become quite interested in urban gardening. Here in Berkeley it is high-status display horticulture in a foodie society (people have raised garden beds in the front of their Craftsman homes, with rows of broccoli and the most elegant heirloom tomatoes you’ve ever seen) and in Oakland, it is activism and community-organisation in the economically blighted parts of the city, where there are no grocery stores which have fresh food. Among some of the immigrant populations of Oakland, like the Hmong, community gardens have provided people places to grow familiar plants not available elsewhere, speak native languages, and help the elderly to socialise. I assumed, initially, that many of the urban gardens of Oakland were built on derelict land, gaps in the urban fabric of the city created by abandoned houses or unused lots. (Some of them were.) I wondered if the urban gardens of early medieval Rome were not similar, and I wondered what I could learn about the past based on the example of the present. So I set out to collect the evidence of early medieval urban gardens not only in Rome but all over Italy, to see who owned gardens, where they were, and to determine if they were household kitchen gardens or market gardens. I also went looking for ‘dark earth’ in archaeological reports. That is the archaeological deposit characteristic of early medieval cities, with thick (.70-3.0+ m) dark soil, few inclusions of potsherds or other materials, and little or no internal stratigraphy. These have been interpreted as abandonment and decay of organic materials used in late antique and early medieval buildings, but more recent thinking suggests that they are actually the archaeological remains of cultivation.I have spent the past few months looking through property documents from Italy up to about 1100, and archaeological reports for major cities: Milan, Verona, Lucca, Rome, Naples, Salerno, Ravenna. What I have found is this: there were urban gardens within the walls of every early medieval city, more in Rome (which was of course the largest city in medieval Europe), fewer in Salerno (which was very small indeed). These were not, on the whole, owned by the poor, or by people who rented houses, but by the elite who owned their own houses, and constituted significant social and economic potential for growing food and providing it/selling it to others.Doc. 82 in the Regesta Sublacense, is a good example of what I have been looking for. The ‘humble monk’ Crescenzio Murcapullo gave his property on the Caelian hill in Rome to the nearby monastery of S. Erasmo in 1003:‘It is a one-story house entirely tiled and shingled, with an oven inside it and a yard and a vined pergola in front of it. Also a garden with fruit trees next to it, with right of passage to a public road, and with all things pertaining to these, located in the region called ‘porta metrovia,’ where I Crescenzio up to now have lived. One one side is the garden of Iohannes Folle. On the other side is the garden of Iohannes, priest and cardinal. And the third and fourth sides are surrounded by public roads.’In the same document he bequeathed a grain-field measuring 13 moggi outside the nearby Porta Metronia, in the Prata Deci (Decenniae), which was surrounded by four other grain fields. Crescenzius himself appeared as neighbour to other parcels which ended up at S. Erasmo, as a renter of other parcels, and then the donor of this land. This seems a rather plush residence and it clearly included land designed for growing grain, vine, fruit trees and vegetables. The urban plot would have been 6900 m2, and his extramural field over 4 times that. Given a ballpark-estimate that in pre-industrial Europe, 40 m2 would grow the vegetables for a single person for an entire year (this is the figure that German agronomists working on Constantinople use), this monk had a very sizeable plot, indeed.Like this example from Rome, these gardens were mostly owned by churchmen. This may be an issue of the documentation (the vast majority of property documents from the period record properties which eventually came to the hands of churches or monasteries), but it also may reflect new social values which emerged in relation to changes in social structures. Abbots and bishops–and priests as well–became powerful figures in early medieval cities, and one of the ways in which they negotiated their new status was by showing themselves to be good managers of estates–a new book by Kristina Sessa  makes this point very clearly. As good estate managers, they provided for their households and their dependents, and also provided charity for the poor and for pilgrims. The gardens attached to their houses, and the many gardens inside monasteries, helped them to do that. Towards the central middle ages, in the eleventh century, populations of Italian cities grew, and so too their economies. Where there had been lots of empty lots in cities and very little in the way of a market for foodstuffs and firewood, in the eleventh century these were sold off and rented out to new people and there were market gardens, mostly outside city walls. Historians have often made the gardens out to be subsistence-level food-production in the gaps left among decaying Roman buildings. I think, however, that they were controlled by the cities’ elites and while the mustard-greens and onions of these gardens may indeed have fed the poor, they did so through a new system of redistribution organised by the cities’ churches.The Medieval Knights, Their Trash, and Urban Gardens Before They Were Trendy by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"34","It’s a rainy day here in Connecticut, but that’s not going to stop me from heading out into the “field.”  Not much has changed since my 2012 post.  I am still employed at the Connecticut Department of Transportation reviewing projects for impacts to archaeological and historic resources, and I am still the Connecticut Archaeology Awareness Month Coordinator.Working in cultural resource management for a state agency is a balancing act.  There are so many transportation projects in the works and only a few people on staff to review them.  One of the things I find most challenging is keeping all of our engineers happy and their projects moving forward while also preserving as many cultural resources as possible.  Everyone’s budget is tight these days, everyone has their own set of priorities, and it’s my job to remind everyone that consideration of cultural resources is a value to the public (and required by federal and state laws).Today my job included the review of a Phase I Archaeological Assessment and Reconnaissance survey report completed by one of our on-call consultants, the review of a project area in Pomfret, CT to assess the archaeological sensitivity of the soils around a bridge that is proposed to be replaced, a visit to a construction site in Waterford, CT where a bridge is being replaced, and a visit to Old Saybrook to visit my old friends from the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center.The project area in Pomfret abuts the historic South Cemetery.  Though the Cemetery will not be directly impacted by the bridge replacement, a temporary utility pole will be installed on the property.  Because this is a project partially funded by the Federal Highway Administration the eligibility of South Cemetery for the National Register of Historic Places will need to be determined to establish whether or not this is a Section 4(f) property in regards to the Department of Transportation Act.  If the Cemetery is deemed eligible the appropriate documentation of the impacts of the use of the property will need to be completed.South Cemetery in Pomfret, CT There were no concerns about the archaeological sensitivity of the project area.  There was plenty of evidence of erosion, disturbance, and filling around the bridge, likely associated with flooding events of the Wappoquia Brook. I stopped by a bridge replacement project in Waterford, CT that I have been monitoring since I began this job last summmer.  There was a Native burial discovered upstream from the bridge decades ago, and the consulting tribes had some concern about any potentially undisturbed soils in the project area.  I check in with the engineer and contractor whenever there is any kind of excavation on site.  So far the entire project area has disturbed soils with a lot of volkswagon parts. Bridge construction on RT 1 in Waterford, CT The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center has funding from the National Park Service’s American Battlefield Protection Program Grant for the Battlefields of the Pequot War project (http://pequotwar.org/).  Currently they are surveying in Old Saybrook, CT and finding evidence of a skirmish between the English, who had a fort at Saybrook Point, and the Pequot.  Today Dave Naumec, senior researcher, found a musket ball!  The Pequot Museum is doing fascinating, ground-breaking work! Dave Naumec finds a musket ball in Old Saybrook, CTPequot War era musket ball found in Old Saybrook, CT Outside of my paying job I have my volunteer responsibilities.  As the CT Archaeology Awareness Month Coordinator I am once again helping to organize an Archaeology Fair.  This year’s Fair is scheduled for October 19th in Wethersfield, CT (shameless plug).  Fortunately, this year I have a Committee of volunteers assisting in the planning of the Fair.  Today I’m sorting out the logistics of having the Fair flyer finalized, printed, and distributed.That sums up my Day of Archaeology.  See you next year!The Another Day in Transportation Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"35","My second “Day of Archaeology”, and a lot has happened in my archaeological life since last year. I have changed companies once (from Wessex Archaeology to Museum of London Archaeology), and internal positions within that company twice (from Archaeologist [general shovelbum], to Archaeologist in the Planning Team [doing desk-based assessments and writing HEAs], to Senior Archaeologist [everything from doing smaller site work alone, to supervising 15-20 staff on a full excavation, and producing the client reports at the end]). All these changes have brought new experiences and skills, and emphasised to me just how much archaeology is a profession in which you never stop learning.So, in many ways, I feel I have travelled pretty far in my career this past year! I think, however, a comparison of this year’s post to last year’s may tell a slightly different story… Morning! 5.30 wake up for my #dayofarch and a fruity breakfast to start the day #omnomnom pic.twitter.com/rkXBS7p8oH— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) July 26, 2013 ***A good thing about working in London is that your site is usually easy to reach by public transport! #dayofarch #commuting— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) July 26, 2013… And also that coffee is never too far away… #dayofarch #wakeywakey— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) July 26, 2013 ***So.

Its proximity to the City means that it has a very good chance of being recorded on the earliest historic maps of London. Its proximity to the City also means there has been a fair amount of development and therefore archaeological work carried out on sites nearby, presenting an overall picture of how this area was used in the past. The fact that most of this site has already been excavated, and this is now the final phase of archaeological investigation here, means that I know what has been found here over the last year and have a pretty firm idea of what to expect…Unfortunately a lot of this was destroyed without record during post-WW2 development – only islands of archaeology survived #dayofarch— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) July 26, 2013“What to expect” also includes the level of archaeological survival on the site. The current building here (now mostly demolished) was put up in the 50s. Heritage assets only started being protected by law with the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, and that was limited to scheduled sites usually of national significance. It was PPG16 (Planning Policy Guidance 16 – Archaeology and Planning) which stepped in as the first legal line of defence for the archaeology and information threatened by any proposals to dig a big hole in the ground. PPG16 is younger than I am – it was only introduced in 1990. It’s not hard to imagine how much archaeology was lost to construction projects across the country before this.The thing that strikes me most about this site, and others I have researched or worked on where there is substantial modern truncation, is how impossible it must have been to be working on a construction project and not notice the things you are tearing out of the ground. There are human remains on this site, and a skull is a pretty self-obvious thing: if you were digging up several you must at least have been scratching your own… PPG16 > PPS5 > NPPF may not be perfect, but sites like this make you so grateful for what it does do and what it does save #dayofarch— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) July 26, 2013PPG16 may have touched the brakes on the bulldozers, but even after successive alterations and re-wording (Planning Policy Statement 5 – Planning for the Historic Environment in 2010, followed by the National Planning Policy Framework in 2012) the legislation is not watertight or without room for interpretation. As our understanding, definition and classification of heritage assets have changed, so too has the law. There are several things in PPS5 which are not in the NPPF – notably the responsibility to monitor the impact of planning and decisions on the historic environment – and where PPS5 contains the “presumption” in favour of conservation, the NPPF only states that a “great weight” is given towards it. The single word I dislike the most in the NPPF is “should”, e.g. “Local Planning Authorities… should require developers to record and advance understanding of…” heritage/archaeology. The word we need to see is “must”.With the pressures on the construction industry to provide more housing (and affordable housing, at that – often simply unprofitable), sustainable development, and long-term employment, planning for the historic environment can be seen as a painful extra hoop to jump through. The one attitude you are guaranteed to face in commercial archaeology is that your work gets in the way of construction projects: it’s too expensive and takes too long. Of all the skilled workers you have working on a building site at any time, the archaeologists are the only people whose work is considered not to matter if it’s not done properly. Of course, if the building isn’t put up safely then lives are at risk. The difference is that the lives lost from bad planning and bad archaeological practice are past and not present – we will never again get the opportunity to see and learn about the people who used to live on the exact spot where we are about to.It all boils down to time and money, the two things that developers have less and less of but which good archaeological practice requires an amount entirely specific to each individual project – the only time you can be accurate as to how much an excavation will cost or how long it will take to do properly is once you have shiny clean natural geology across the site and a comprehensive primary archive of single context records.I will end my “Day of Archaeology” post with a few final thoughts on money and heritage protection, which were thrown up exactly one month ago and much discussed amongst the archaeologists of Twitter.Buried in small print: English Heritage gets £80m to become 'self-financing in due course' http://t.co/ectb9H0gwT— Sharon Heal (@Sharonheal) June 26, 2013""Self-financing"", eh? Privatising the heritage sector? Being a public resource is inherent to the whole concept of heritage!— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013Osborne is basically handing over the public's interest in the protection of their heritage, built and archaeological, to private interest.— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013Private interest, however good it's intentions, relies on profit which is monetary and not social, cultural or intellectual…— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013This very conflict of interest is already evident in commercial archaeology – developers give work to the company with the lowest bid.— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013Archaeology companies lower their costs to get the work, but then have insufficient resources to do the whole job to a good standard.— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013(Or perhaps, archaeology companies lower their costs to get the work, but then have to do that work only with the resources that they have available, regardless of the nature and extent of the archaeology that eventually turns out to be in the ground.)And it's the heritage which is lost in all of this, and the public who miss out on that heritage.— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013I am struggling to see how EH becoming ""self-financing"" might improve the current situation.— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013Part of me is actually afraid that this severing of public interest in the heritage sector is a precursor to more changes in planning…— Emily Wright (@VitaEmilia) June 27, 2013This remains to be seen. Perhaps a few years down the line the “Day of Archaeology” resource might be instrumental to that aspect of PPS5 which the NPPF did not see fit to retain – the monitoring of the impact of planning and decisions on the historic environment – by monitoring the profession of archaeology which has grown around it. The Rubble, rubble, toil and trouble… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"36","After a day spent mostly offline due to a PC rebuild at work, I’ve been catching up this evening, reading many of the wonderful and varied stories from this Day of Archaeology.As a founder member of Heritage Action, and one of the Features Editors on the Heritage Journal (see http://www.heritageaction.org.uk) I’m not an archaeologist by any stretch of the imagination, but thought I’d write a few words for this Day of Archaeology from my viewpoint as a self-confessed ‘megarak’. In many ways I could be considered the average target audience for the Day: a member of the public, outside of the profession, looking to see how and why things are done, and to understand just what goes on.I know my viewpoint could be considered by some to be a narrow and prejudiced one. The primary focus of Heritage Action is the pre-Roman remains of the peoples of what came to be known as the British Isles. Our tagline is ‘Ordinary people, caring for Extraordinary places’. By a marvelous piece of serendipity, today is Heritage Action’s tenth birthday, so let me take you back to our humble beginnings on that warm July day in 2003…It may come as some surprise to those within the archaeological arena to be told that there are a large number of the public out there, interested not only in the wonderful historical treasures that archaeology brings to the fore, but also in the (some would say) unloved ‘lumps and bumps’ of the islands’ prehistory. This interest has spawned several dedicated websites on the subject over the years. Of these, the Megalithic Portal is probably best known to many readers here due to its wider scope, but the Modern Antiquarian (TMA),  based upon Julian Cope’s book of the same name is where my interest came to the fore and many long lasting friendships blossomed.In those early days, the gazetteer entries on the Portal were much more ‘fact-based’ whilst TMA’s site notes were more concerned with people describing their experiences and thoughts from their visits, along with links to Folklore related to the sites. By comparison, the Portal was seen as more ‘out there’ with it’s acceptance on the forums of some of those ideas less well accepted by the scientific community – Ley Lines, Geomantics, Dowsing etc. The TMA forum seemed a much more serious place to me, with discussions ranging on the why, and how of the listed sites.And it was here that the idea was mooted of a picnic meet-up for like minded folk to get together and chat. The site chosen was the Uffington White Horse, the oldest chalk hill figure in the country. With a nearby earthwork (Uffington Castle), and a neolithic chamber tomb, Wayland’s Smithy a short walk away there would be plenty to see and talk about.In the end a group of around a dozen people came together for the first time that day, and with several prominent sites under threat at that time (development, vandalism, all the usual problems) discussion turned to the idea of a campaign group for ‘ordinary people’ to highlight these wonderful places that we all enjoyed so much. So it was that Heritage Action came to be. We have held a ‘HA Megameet’ at Avebury annually ever since that day, with more people attending every year.Back to the present and members have joined, members have left, some have sadly passed over but there remains a solid core of people from that first picnic. Still interested in bringing some of the lesser known prehistoric sites to wider public attention, but also campaigning against what we see as the random destruction of the archaelogical resource, whether that be from development or from hobbyist metal detectorists. Our tenth birthday today is cause for some celebration as we feel we have managed to make a difference over the years, attitudes are slowly changing – we even have some archaeologists openly agreeing with our point of view on sometimes controversial issues.So finally a plea – if you care for the prehistory of Britain from anything other than a purely academic viewpoint, please consider writing a short article for the Heritage Journal. We can guarantee a decent audience with over 4500 followers on Twitter and around 10000 hits per month on our web site which publishes a new article nearly every day.The A Day of Archaeology (Once Upon a Time) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"39","This year’s day of archaeology starts more or less where I ended last year. I have spent the past 13 months working in Albintimilium, the archaeological site of the ancient city at the frontier of Italy. The work is a mixture of several things: on weekends, the site is open to the public and with my colleague I guide visitors through the small introductory exhibition, the Roman baths (with mosaics, too), the city walls and the Roman theatre. We could have more people visiting us, admittedly, but in April and May we had many schools. As you can imagine, 10 years old kids are much smarter at understanding the Romans than most adults, let alone archaeologists, will ever be, so there’s some satisfaction in it.On weekdays, the work is different and it varies from coding open source databases for archaeological finds to cataloguing of Early Medieval architectural decoration. And, of course, Roman pottery. Lots of Roman pottery, as in two entire buildings filled with more than 5000 crates of stuff. Some of these finds date back to 1915! The vast majority is resulting from the more than 30 years of excavation by Nino Lamboglia, who pioneered stratigraphy and chrono-typology in Roman archaeology starting as early as 1938. All this material needs reviewing, reordering, cleaning etc. on a regular basis. For some reason, the recent finds are the ones who need the most work. This month I am going through some 140 crates from excavations carried out in the 1980s at the Late Roman and Medieval site of Costa Balenae (gallery of images from Wikimedia Commons), some 30 km away from Ventimiglia.An older inventory. Note that it was written entirely on paper records.From a general inventory done some years ago we already know that 90% or even more of these finds is made of bricks and tiles, and I am separating actual pottery and amphorae into smaller and more manageable bags. Bricks and tiles need to be stored separately, and the best approach to quantification is probably by using weight. One may also suggest that, once a quantification is available and no particular differences can be seen in fabrics or shapes, they can be disposed of, allowing us to save a lot of space in the ever-crowded building. The remaining pottery will be processed in further detail, even though at a first look its breakage rate is very high and that will pose serious identification problems, not to speak about functional interpretation. Quite surprisingly for a site that has Late Roman phases, I could not see but one small piece of African Red Slip (or terra sigillata chiara as Lamboglia labelled it in the 1950s) so far. I have only reviewed 15% of the material however.Not Roman! 19th or 20th century glazed pottery.What is perhaps most interesting is that there are some pottery finds that are not Roman, such as this big sherd of a late 19th or early 20th c. basin. There is little evidence of stratigraphic contexts for these so I assume they came from the topsoil cleaning done before the actual excavation. I have written before about the need to adopt a less mechanical approach to work done on finds, without forgetting that storage facilities are not separate from the real world and they tell stories that should be very familiar for an archaeologist. For example, at least 3 different people must have been doing some kind of work on these finds before myself, based on the different handwritings I can see on the finds, on the labels, on the inventory. There should be a record of who they are, but I couldn’t find one yet.Instagram filters will make anything look beautiful. Almost anything at least.Is this the best time of the year for this kind of work? Not really, as the temperature is constantly above 30 °C during the day. However during the winter it would be much less comfortable (cold, rain, not enough natural light) and spring is always busy with schools as I said above. There is also a lot of dust in the bags, so I need to wear a dust-mask. Not a good item to wear in the summer if you ask me. The other reason for doing this right now is that there are new excavations ongoing (since a few years actually) at the site and reviewing the extent of older excavations together with their finds is very important. What I forgot to mention, but it should be obvious by now, is that this material was never published ‒ as happened for many other excavations done in that period. Nowadays the situation is slightly better, even though in general there is a lower detail in the short reports that get regularly published. My day of archaeology was dedicated to making these finds easier to manage and study.The Digging for Roman Pottery by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"40","This is meAs a Finds Liaison Officer (FLO) for the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) life is never straightforward and it is guaranteed that the minute you plan out what is happening during the week – everything changes. With this in mind – rather than just telling you  what I did today – I thought I would recap the whole week. I have left the everyday bits out and instead you have the edited highlights:MondayRecording Archaeological finds from the Hereford Metal Detecting Club – finds recording is what I (and all FLOs) spend most of our days doing. Whether it is recording broken buckles or corroded coins or exceptional artefacts they all add to the rich tapestry that is lurking beneath the English and Welsh landscape.TuesdayMorning meeting with the head of the museum service in Shropshire, County Archaeologist and Historic Environment Staff.  This is a chance for everyone working within the Council environment to catch up on what has happened and what is planned – sounds dull but was fascinating – especially as I had the opportunity to contribute important new sites discovered recently through recorded finds to the discussions. The sites of which will now be flown over by the HER team as part of their summer season of aerial photography.South Shropshire Ringcopyright PASLunchtime: Coroner holds an inquest into a gold post Roman ring discovered in South Shropshire. The ring is of National Importance (see PAS record). It is unlikely to have been worn on a finger – instead it is more likely to have either decorated a sword pommel or be a form of toggle / woggle / dress decoration. The date of the find is the really important and interesting as we have very little information about post Roman Shropshire (apart from what is known from Wroxeter). This find is likely to be of continental – possibly Byzantine – origin and as such is another link between Western Britain and what remains of the Eastern Roman EmpireTeatime: Talk to the local BBC radio Shropshire on their drive time show about the find, metal detecting and treasureWednesdayMore treasure things – giving information to local press – about the ring from South ShropshireBBC and Shropshire StarAfternoon: Advertise PAS Finds Recording Assistant for the West Midlands – Headley Trust Intern. The West Midlands team of FLOs was awarded a bursary post  at the beginning of the financial year to help train and develop finds professionals / post graduate students in identifying and recording archaeological finds. This internship is offered part time over 6 months and will be based with me in Ludlow Museum Resource Centre. Visit the PAS vacancies website for more information!ThursdayBack to recording the finds from the Hereford Club – something that should have been finished earlier in the week!Afternoon – 3:30 Call from a couple of local metal detectorists to say that they had found a Roman coin hoard could I come out and have a look as they uncovered a small group of coins and stoppped.  This is exactly what we advise people to do when finding objects which are obviously still associated with an archaeological context.So I went out to the site in XXXXXX (sorry if I told you where it was – I would have to kill you) to see what it was that they had uncovered!Roman coin hoardThe hoard looks to be lying beneath the ploughsoil and be undisturbed! From what could be seen – the hoard is most likely to date from the late 3rd Century AD and be positioned beneath a stone. This period (260-290 ish AD) has a huge number (over 660 at the last count) of hoards put in the ground – this phenomenon is currently being investigated by a specially funded archaeological project organised by the British Museum and University of Leicester (see here).a few of the coinsAs there were more coins in the ground it was decided that it would be better to leave them and return to excavate the following week so all the archaeological information can be captured.bottom of the holeEvening Rush home and have quick wash and brush up: Then straight back out to Ludlow Museum for a evening fundraiser in aid of The Bitterley Hoard.Bitterley HoardLast year for the Day of Archaeology I spent alot of time blogging about this really important civil war hoard from South Shropshire (see here) which had just made the news. Well, a year later the Shropshire Museums and the Friends of Ludlow Museum are trying hard to raise the monies to acquire and conserve this hoard (see here).Crowds in Ludlow MuseumThe event was well attended (with over 120 people) - and I even said a few words about what the hoard was, why it was important. Lottie, chair of the friends, then said what the Museum hoped to do with it when / if it were acquired.Peter talking – standing next to the finder Howard MurphyThe hoard is the largest civil war group of coins found in Shropshire in modern times and due to the level of preservation the leather purse in which it was deposited is remarkably well preserved. If you want to help save the hoard – and conserve it for display in Ludlow Museum then you can make a contribution through the Friends ‘Just Giving’ webpage.FridayBack to the office and recording those finds – as well as catching up on a weeks worth of phone and email messages.

"41","Archaeologists and Metal Detectorists collaborating near Montpelier, The James Madison Estate.I’ve been metal detecting as a hobby since age 15.  As my mastery of the equipment and abilities to identify and explore sites  improved, so did my respect for the Archaeological community.  I discovered the long-view of our own form of time-travel and now I spend a fair bit of time assisting Archaeologists and Preservationists with my skills.   I am hopeful that I will do this even more in the future.  Along the way, I’ve taken a keen interest in encouraging cooperation between the groups in the USA, considering the important work done by professionals while considering the rights of the hobbyists to enjoy their pastime on private property.Because of this position,  I am asked my opinion about the disputes that emerge between groups and how we might address them.  I thought I would spend a few moments to give a broad, high-level view of some of my answers.  This perspective earns me few metal detecting friends.  I’m rarely invited to drinks and am sometimes chastised in the metal detecting forums for siding with the “archies” on many issues.   Some cannot understand why I hate the “American Diggers” reality show with such passion.It seems to me that this list, or one like it, extended and massaged, could form the first steps in a meaningful dialogue to bring together those willing from both groups.   These questions come up again and again in forums, radio programs and at club meetings:1. We metal detect at old homesteads “long forgotten” by Academia.  What value do archaeologists see in the ‘relics’ of say an 1840′s homestead in rural MO, or one of the well-documented, yet non-major/non-significant Civil War skirmish sites? And how to do they see this as valuable to society?Broadly from my observations as a detectorist, Archaeologists think in terms of an infinite timeline.  Faced with limited resources, prioritization about how limited academic resources are used is required, but this does not mean giving up on a location to a free-for-all by relic hunters.   Many instead consider it a “professional” postponement for dozens perhaps hundreds of years – where future archaeologists, equipped with android field workers, nano-bot goo and virtual reality might glean new information from a common site and the information preserved by previous generations.The detecting community shifts in their seats when asked to leave objects in the ground, especially as we watch 10-ton equipment deeply till soil in a field or bulldozers dig up sites for new homes.   It seems that with improved cooperation, a tag-team approach could save the data from these sites when Archaeologists are unable to commit resources and CRM firms are not required.   Objects and context do not last forever – and some sites (especially unprotected, private land) will clearly never be considered for research.  There must be a balancing act in there some where – a class system for sites perhaps, or a certification program for access.2. What if detectorists become more rigorous and find a way to productively contribute to the data set?Detectorists willing to gather find data on private property hunts may have a role to play in discovering / describing historic sites– not unlike archaeologists attending relic hunting club meetings to learn about member’s findings.  It may be easy to see detectorists’ motivations for the rush of a great find, but it’s hard for Archaeologists to respect this because it rarely involves building reliable data or preserving an object’s provenance.   Could we employ detectorists in some way to drive low-resolution data into a common pool?  Would it be helpful?The enabling technologies for data collection are here now – smartphones, including those sealed from the elements, are now on the market.  Some metal detectors have built-in GPS and data paths to Google Earth.   And what about how to get detectorists excited about participating?  Why not appeal to friendly competition – not for most valuable objects, but for best data gathering?   Badges, rank or simple online mentions  (think Klout for Metal Detectorists) could incentivize the detecting community to work with Archaeology and add to the data sets even during weekend outings.3. Why do Archaeologists want to let artifacts fade to dust ?This is a common theme in the detectorist conversations – sometimes illustrated with barely-identifiable buttons dissolved with fertilizer or iron objects heavily damaged by plows or livestock.  Detectorists believe that artifacts will fade to dust if not retrieved and such retrieval is often delayed beyond the point of no return by lack of Archaeology resources.   I try to explain, often unsuccessfully, that while objects do degrade, they do so on a very long timescale, and by removing them from the soil, you frequently accelerate their destruction.  Archaeologists have a limited capacity to properly preserve and conserve objects properly, so the preference is often to leave the objects in the ground.  Detectorists see this as a race against time – will the objects be “saved” before the someday-maybe professional excavates the area?   You can see why this discussion gets heated.4. Why do Archaeologists not engage detectorists more often?I would hope to hear from many of you with your own reasons.   I’m not saying that the professional community never reaches out – some do.   But the detecting community does not perceive it that way.I think that some Archaeologists are fearful of the implications to their career which may come from engaging with metal detectorists.  It’s understandable, as Relic Hunters have (and do) decimated significant sites world-wide.  And now, (un) reality TV shows keep focus on the value of artifacts in “dollars and cents,” to keep audiences… despite the fact that most hobbyists rarely sell anything they find.  It is the detecting / relic hunting community’s burden to overcome this with increasingly trusted relations and productive partnerships.  But those can be hard to begin.Secondly, there is an assumption, I believe from personal observation, that detectorists are often unable to comprehend scholarly hypothesis, methodology, interpretation and conclusions drawn up by professionals.  I say that, while there are a number of “slack jaws” in our ranks who scoff at quarter-inch screening and fiddly note-taking, there are also some highly enlightened historians with broad field and lab skills.  I have myself witnessed seasoned detectorists and the equipment they master transform the productivity of a survey site, bringing many new ideas with them.5. How should Archaeologists engage with detectorists such that the relationship and outcome is co-beneficial?I have found that when detectorists are actively involved in the hypothesis and planning for a given survey or research project, a lot of potential and productive energy is released.   The conversations shift from artifact-centric and “field technician” discussions to team-oriented, long-view and conclusion-centric collaborations.  I’ve heard a seasoned and skilled detectorists ask… “Why do they just want me to report beeps in my assigned grid?  Why don’t they use my 30 years of experience in locating and pinpointing sites?”It’s worth mentioning that detectorists come from all walks of life.  They can be influential in the communities in which they live.  Furthermore, when Archaeologists participate with “ordinary citizens” and the process becomes less abstract and mysterious thanks to their advocacy,   public support for Archaeology may improve.   As the baby-boomer generation begins to explore their heritage, we may see an increase in interest which could be very good for community Archaeology and financial support.6. What technologies could help with Archaeology and Detectorist Community Cooperation?As a new generation of digital-ready, social-media savvy metal detectorists and Archaeologists enter the ranks, interesting dynamics emerge.  The “digital relic hunt” has detectorists locating and photographing finds in-situ, then sharing them with online social networks.   This “Like” and “Share” gratification is similar to the relic-hunt-club meetings with wooden display cases spread around the room.  Might this be something we could tap?  The thrill of finds keeps their hobby interesting while actual objects are kept in context, bound for proper cataloging and preservation.    Even simply photographing objects found and sharing with trusted, local Archaeologists in a “cloud” storage folder might offer some interesting outcomes.Some other discussions we’ve had include US-version of the Portable Antiquities Scheme which is tech-based and better suited for our property culture.  We discuss how improved GPS accuracy and shared databases in the cloud could provide a steady river of information to academia, while addressing the privacy concerns of property owners.  And field use of tablets, smartphone applications and more mean that the lowly relic hunter is more plugged in than ever to the online world.  It seems there should be a way for us to plug in to the Archaeology community, too!Postscript:  Forgive any sloppiness above – I wrote this on the day of the #dayofarch project and in some haste. Thanks for allowing a non-academic enter your ranks and participate in this fun experiment.   If you would like to review some of my other views and my ever-evolving perspective on this issue, please subscribe to my blog at http://www.detecting.us.    I would love your input, your debates and to become a bit better friends with you all.The Metal Detecting and Archaeological Advocacy – Some Observations and Ideas from a Detectorist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"42","Painting of Santa Rosa stolen from the church of the Bolivian village of Jesus de Machaca and recovered on the London art market in 2011 (image via. Bolivia’s Ministry of Cultures)Although I am a trained field archaeologist, I now work for a criminology department. I study the looting of archaeological and historic sites and the transnational trade in illicit cultural property. That is what I am doing now, in La Paz, Bolivia, 3700 feet above sea level, thanks to a Fulbright grant and a Leverhulme fellowship.I am part of the University of Glasgow and the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research’s Trafficking Culture project. My research group is approaching looting and antiquities trafficking from new angles to hopefully come up with interesting regulatory responses to this problem. Besides larger criminological and market analyses, our project is engaged in several regional case studies. That is where I fit in. I am looking into this phenomenon in Latin America and, right now, in Bolivia.At the moment I am working on the looting of remote Conquest-era churches and the international market for stolen ecclesiastical paintings, sculpture and silver. The Andes are filled with rural churches: they were part of the evangelising mission of the Spanish Conquistadors. These churches are filled with spectacular and regionally-specific art. Most notable in Bolivia is silver work: for several hundred years the majority of the world’s silver came from Bolivia and Indigenous artists had a ready supply to make thousands of beautiful objects of devotion. Unfortunately there are collectors out there who are willing to buy stolen church art and, as supply meets demand, poor Bolivian communities are robbed of their heritage.This church at the Bolivian village of Laja was robbed in 2012 (wikimedia commons)Bolivia is culturally rich but economically poor. These churches are in bad states of repair and are insecure. Many cannot be alarmed, even if they are located in an area with electricity, because there is no money for such things. In most of the villages where churches are located residents live well below the poverty line so the idea of paying a full time guard is laughable. Increase police presence? Not when the nearest police outpost is 100km away over an unpaved road. Not when this country is thought to have one of the most corrupt police forces in the Americas.But even the most important and well-protected Bolivian churches are not safe. In April the church of the Virgin of Copacabana, Bolivia’s most holy and miraculous shrine, was robbed of the silver and gold that anointed the Virgin herself. The baby Jesus in her arms was stolen as well. A priest who was at Copacabana on temporary assignment was jailed this week for involvement in the robbery. The holy pieces have not been recovered. My guess is that they were carried into Peru and then on to anonymity. That was the 6th church robbery in Bolivia in only 4 months.A 17th century painting of the Virgin of Copacabana surrounded by silver (public domain)I am constantly asked why these silver-filled churches were not robbed before. If they have been sitting out there, vulnerable, for 500 years why are they only being robbed now? The best answer I can give is that there was no illicit market for these items before. These churches are being robbed because terrible people want to own beautiful things.I warn I am writing in advance because my day will include being without internet.So what will my day be? On this day of archaeology I will take a taxi to the La Paz cemetery then squish myself into a minibus. I will head westward for about two hours until I reach the famous UNESCO World Heritage Site of Tiwanaku.Tiwanaku is a vast, monumental, pre-Inka site that I excavated at (when I was a diggy-archaeologist) back in 2004 and 2005. I am sad to say that in 2011 Tiwanaku’s conquest-era church was robbed. It wasn’t the first time. The thieves have not been arrested and the objects stolen have not been recovered. I am going out there to talk to old friends about the robbery. I am interested to hear their perceptions about how the theft could have been prevented, their thoughts on the response of public authorities, and how they feel the robbery has affected the community. I want to hear the facts but I also want to hear wild speculation, rumours, and emotion. I think emotion is very important in this kind of work.Tiwanaku’s conquest-era church was built by the Spanish from stoned looted from the nearby World Heritage site. It was robbed in 2011 (photo by the author)And, really, this is an emotional issue with grave consequences. Just last year two men were caught robbing the church in the small Bolivian village of Quila Quila. The villagers apprehended the men and, in a public display of frustration, insecurity, and fear, they lynched the alleged robbers and buried them behind the church.A ruined and abandoned church in the Altiplano, Bolivia’s high plain (Jduranboger, CC attribution)I don’t think most people imagine that what I do is archaeology (even the Day of Archaeology website doesn’t have a category for this post to fit into!), but I think that it is. The past is what we say it is, and we believe that the physical remains of the past are important. That they are worthy of being preserved as tools of both memory and identity. When they are ripped from their contexts and sold on the black market,  everyone loses. We are all robbed because we will never get to know the information those objects contained. “Neocolonialism” is a word that is bandied about quite a bit in Bolivia: it is a word that even people with no education know. The illicit antiquities trade is a prime example of neocolonialism. When objects are stolen from vulnerable areas of the developing world and moved into the hands of rich people in the developed world, we perpetuate an unjust imbalance. We keep people down.This is my dream job. I am so thankful to be able to do this research.The High Crimes: Studying the Illicit Antiquities Trade in the Bolivian Andes by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"44","Today, Lisa Maher is getting on a plane to return to her field project in Azraq, Jordan. It has been a fast and furious couple of days as the Codifi implementation team put some finishing touches on an alpha version of the EFAP1 Codifi database for her to play with on her iPad.For this season, Lisa and her team will continue to document everything using paper forms, but one of the cool factors for Codifi is the ability to put everything into “context” – forms, photos, videos, people, events. Lisa will use Scanner Pro – an iPad app that will “scan” anything and turn it into multipage PDFs – for adding her paper forms directly to the Locus database entries. This will save scads of time in post-excavation.This season is an opportunity for Lisa to give digital recording a try and provide us with real-world feedback on the application. We know we will learn a lot from the experience. The plan is to take the feedback and help her to produce a type specification that can be slotted into her forthcoming grant applications. We will be reporting back with news as the season progresses on our blog!The Epipalaeolithic Foragers in Azraq Project by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"45","After a busy few weeks at the museum celebrating the Festival of Archaeology, we held our last event today. A small group from the Bolton Archaeology and Egyptology Society visited the museum’s new storage facility. They got to see some artefacts that had been hiding away in a dark store for years.One of the objects we looked at was this unidentified item from Amarna, any guesses to what it is??The group also advised us on our plans for a Heritage Lottery Fund project to create a new Egypt Gallery. Bolton Museum has around 12,000 artefacts in the Egypt collection. The biggest benefactor was a local mill owners daughter, Annie Barlow (1863-1941). She became the Local Secretary for the Egyptian Exploration Society and donated her finds to the museum.Annie Barlow in 1931 with Mahatma GandhiA new gallery along with an online database will make this collection even more accessible to the public.

"46","My name’s Rachael Sparks, and I’m Keeper of the Institute of Archaeology Collections at University College London. My role here is document and manage our collections, deal with queries and visiting researchers, provide objects for classes, and manage our small army of volunteers, in between teaching, marking, supervising postgraduate work, fielding ethics queries from our students and doing my own research. And whatever else is required.Today feels like a bit of a holiday. We’re still in a mini heat wave here in London, for one. And I find myself with the luxury of a bit of time to do a few odd jobs.For the past few weeks, I’ve been host to a visiting researcher from La Sapienza, Rome, who came to photograph our Jericho collections, so I’ve been kept busy wheeling objects in and out of the store. It must be something about July; this time 2 years ago I was hosting two other students from the same university. However she finally finished up yesterday, and today I have no visitors, no scheduled meetings, and no commitments.To treat myself, I’ve decided to go and work in one of the classrooms upstairs, where part of our collections are stored.The thing about classrooms is that people have a habit of teaching in them. While this is great from an educational point of view, it’s not so great when it comes to accessing collections storage. There is nothing more disheartening than filling a trolley up with objects, rolling down the corridors, navigating the lifts, and arriving at your destination, only to find the door shut on a roomful of people, busy doing something or other.After a few wasted journeys, I became an expert in the lecture timetable, and began posting laminated room schedules all over the building.But now its summer break, classes are over, and timetables mean nothing. I now have the chance to go boldly in and audit and reorganise the collections stored in these teaching spaces without opposition. Luxury!My plan for the day is to replace all the old cardboard trays in the drawers, used to group objects according to site, period, technology or whatever, with lovely, crisp brown acid-free trays. I have two sizes to play with at the moment: rectangular, and square. They are nice and strong, and held together with brass staples, which won’t develop blooms of rust like the staples on our old object trays.See how they rust…The trays that I am replacing date back anytime from the 1930s to the 1970s, and were most definitely not what we would call conservation-grade. In many cases, they weren’t really trays at all – people would grab any old lids or bases from glass slide boxes, photography paper, stationary supplies – you name it, if it was flat and had sides, it would do.These days of course, they most definitely won’t do, particularly as the older examples have now turned brittle and tend to break apart in your hands. The modern equivalent, the photocopy paper box lid, is even worse, as they are fairly flimsy affairs stuck together with rather weak glue.Old object trays for the discard pile.So out with the old, and in with the new, custom-made, beautiful replacement trays. It cost a shockingly large slice of our annual budget to get these made, but it was worth it.So up to the fourth floor, where I attack our flint technology drawers, which are used a lot in teaching and tend to get a bit jumbled up as a result. In between renewing trays, I move a few bits around until I’m happy things are more or less where they should be.Three hours later, and I’m tired of climbing up ladders, so I go back down to my office for a cup of tea. By now, I’ve got a puddle of misplaced objects to sort out, so I take down their accession numbers with me to check against the database.Making the tea reminds me to check my emails. Bad mistake. I now spend the next half an hour dealing with ethics queries, requests for meetings, and an inappropriately addressed survey on something I know nothing about. Then to checking those numbers, which turn out to be more complicated than I had thought because a couple of digits have worn off and I have to figure out what object I’m actually looking at.Is this a dagger I see before me? No, it’s a scraper, so that must be a ‘0’ not a ‘6’….Back upstairs, where all the hot air generated by the lecturers living on the floors below has risen to make the room now ever so slightly uncomfortable. I find it is even hotter at the top of the ladder than at the bottom. I push on through, but finally give up mid afternoon, having managed to replace the trays in some two thirds of the cabinets.Drawer of flint tools, after replacing the old trays with the newSo back to my blissfully cool basement, where I turn to putting away the last of the Jericho finds from yesterday’s research visit. A couple of drawers of beads and flints go back in place, and as a reward I get a centimetre-long splinter from our old wooden drawers. This also confirms my suspicion that our new, economical, paper-thin green gloves were not such a good buy after all; splinters used to bounce off the old gloves.Then, for the last task of the day, up to the Leventis Gallery of Cypriot and Eastern Mediterranean archaeology, to put a handful of objects back on display. Several of these are featuring in our new temporary exhibition, The Key Ingredient: Food in Social Relationships, put on by an enthusiastic group of Museum Studies students. If you’re passing UCL, do drop in and have a look.Vessels from Jericho Tomb A94, currently on display in the Leventis Gallery at the Institute of Archaeology, UCL.That’s the end of my day.

"49","PROYECTO DE TESIS DE PREGRADOManuel Lozano Varela (Universidad de Externado)Análisis de subsistencia y selección de recursos en Punta de Pájaro, un posible yacimiento del Formativo temprano: Ciénaga de Guájaro, AtlánticoFaltan 10 minutos para las 6:00 am, despierto en una hamaca y pienso al igual que días anteriores que soy privilegiado al poder estar viviendo un sueño y aún más que este sea mi futuro, ya que es la profesión que escogí. No soy médico, ni arquitecto, ni piloto de Fórmula Uno, ni futbolista del Liverpool de Inglaterra, soy Arqueólogo y aunque el 90% de las personas que he tratado en mi vida no supieran que significaba ser arqueólogo de mi boca lograron enterarse que soy feliz, que viajo todos los días sin tener máquina del tiempo a lugares que habitó el hombre en diversas temporalidades.Retornando a la primera línea de este escrito y la hamaca, me encuentro a más o menos 1000 km de Bogotá, la capital de Colombia, y un tanto más de mi hogar. Llevo 20 días viviendo en una población de pescadores (Aguada de Pablo – Departamento del Atlántico, Colombia) e intento arrancarle algunas verdades a un suelo lleno de arena y cantos rodados, sobre todo quiero saber qué animales hacían parte de las dieta de grupos humanos hace más o menos 5000 años, saber sobre preferencias de consumo y los hábitats que estaban siendo visitados para capturar las presas. Hasta el momento intuyo que eran hábitats de Ciénaga, Bosques de Galería, zonas de Sabana con un clima semi húmedo y una temperatura promedio de 35°C, que hacia el mediodía se eleva a los 40°C.6:15, después de algunas meditaciones y la habitual pereza de las mañanas me dirijo hacia mi ducha, que se compone de dos cubetas llenas de agua y una taza, tengo todo el patio para bañarme y creo que nunca me había sentido tan libre. Después del primer refrescante baño del día me visto, recojo mi equipo y me dirijo a desayunar. Me doy el lujo de desayunar con pescado que no lleva más de un par de horas fuera del agua y su sabor es inigualable, en ningún restaurante de donde vivo he probado mejor pescado. Con la primer comida del día en mi estómago y saliendo de la casa de la familia de Dayro, quien es mi maño derecha y un nativo del pueblo con amplia experiencia en diferentes proyectos arqueológicos en la zona, comienza en verdad la jornada de trabajo. Estamos a más o menos 20 min, lo que serían kilómetro y medio del sitio arqueológico Punta de Pájaro, razón por  la cual estoy tan feliz y tan lejos de casa. No caminamos solos, nos acompañan Luis Fernando, Mauricio, Fabián y Nayith, un grupo de amigos bastante peculiar y el cual me adoptó muy amistosamente a mi llegada. Además de ser buena compañía son excelentes buscando huesos en el cernidor y por ello son las nuevas contrataciones de mi primer equipo de trabajo en campo. No pude haber obtenido mejores amigos y compañeros para un largo día.La mañana transcurre entre vallenatos, risas, fragmentos de cerámica, algunas lascas y abundantes restos de fauna, entre la que identifico de manera preliminar, gran cantidad de peces, dos especies de tortuga, roedores y posiblemente venados. A escasos metros se ve pasar también la jornada de trabajo de los pescadores de la zona, se mueven al ritmo del viento con sus velas hinchadas y con algún botín expresado en unos cuantos kilos de buen pescado. Al verlos navegar hábilmente y poner sus trampas imagino que las personas que habitaron el lugar que excavo seguramente no tenían un día muy diferente, y que los peces al ser un recurso constante serian bastante importantes. Aun con todos los cambios en el entorno, la pérdida del bosque y la contaminación actual,  la vista, la brisa y el alimento debieron ser las condiciones más afables para vivir y para el favorable desarrollo de las relaciones sociales.Seis horas han transcurrido desde mi despertar, entre algunas divagaciones, observaciones y buena música caribeña, el estómago comienza a rugir como un león. 20 días almorzando exactamente al medio día crean hábito o lo crean. Se hace el break del almuerzo el cual se encuentra caliente ya que Diógenes, el hermano de Dayro, o algunas veces Rafa, integrante del grupo de amigos, lo ha traído en moto hace pocos minutos. Se empiezan a ver algunas nubes en el horizonte amenazando con hacer del final de la tarde una experiencia bastante húmeda, y aunque en días anteriores descansábamos más de una hora en el almuerzo, ahora con el tiempo respirando sobre mi nuca no son más de 20 minutos. Los muchachos no hacen caso de las nubes y siguen mi ritmo ya que se  ha creado más que un vínculo laboral, uno personal, y me ayudan a poder cumplir mi meta.No me quedan más de 10 días de trabajo, al bajar centímetro tras centímetro el material comienza a escasear, aparecen algunas cuentas de collar que hacen del día más productivo y más particular para los muchachos.Ellos muchas veces no entendían que el tesoro para mí en esa excavación estaba representado por cada hueso sin importar el tamaño, y no en algún metal precioso. Ante cada hallazgo de un fragmento cerámico con la representación de un animal, un fragmento considerable de caparazón de tortuga o una mandíbula de roedor me deleito escuchando las explicaciones de mi equipo de trabajo, y siento que a pesar de no estar generando miles de empleos o presentando el proyecto ante multitudes, creo conciencia, llego de cierta manera a las personas y las empapo del deseo de buscar una explicación de la eterna relación del hombre con la naturaleza.The Un día de campo (Colombia) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"50","I’m very privileged to be on sabbatical at the moment (supported by a University of Bristol Institute for Advanced Study Research Fellowship) and I’m spending my time as a Visiting Scholar in the Anthropology Department at University of British Columbia (http://anth.ubc.ca/). While my PhD was in Archaeology & Prehistory from Sheffield, I have always focused my research on the expressions and performance of archaeology in the contemporary world, paying specific attention to archaeology and the moving image. That means I research and write about TV documentaries, the archaeological information in home movies and video, the ways in which artists engage with archaeological themes, places and material in their film and video practices, and even the archaeology of screen landscapes. So, it’s really archaeology on screen and the archaeology of screens. While I’m employed by University of Bristol in the newly renamed Department of Music, Film, Theatre (previously, Drama: Theatre, Film, Television), I co-run the MA in Archaeology for Screen Media with colleagues in Archaeology & Anthropology.My sabbatical is meant to be focused entirely on writing up my research on the screen landscapes of the Vancouver and London Olympic Games and I try to maintain a blog on this and everything urban screen related (http://aapiccini.wordpress.com/). However, the ease of networked communication means that my days out here in western Canada are not so different from my days in western England: a mix of administration, communication, fragmented writing, editing, proof reading, commenting on others’ work, maintaining research networks, struggling with universities’ conflicting network preferences, supervising PhD students, applying for funding and looking for new opportunities, having meetings, coordinating social media, and sending resource requests for next year’s teaching. Before the days of constant communication, I could focus on a single task but now it’s all about multi-tasking and ensuring that I’m circulating that information more widely. Often just beginning one thing on my ‘to do’ list will generate ten more things that all seem to need to be done simultaneously. However, I take heart in being reminded of Walter Benjamin’s essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’, in which he argued that distraction and the mass absorption of art by the people had a more progressive political force than the studied attention to aesthetics (see Paul Graves-Brown’s blog http://slightlymuddy.com/kuriosum/?p=183) and also in Jonathan Crary’s great book, Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle and Modern Culture (2001, MIT Press). While we might want to follow Guy Debord (The Society of the Spectacle, 1967) to criticize all this spectacle, it’s useful for me to remember that focused attention is historically and politically contingent, too.So, you get the picture that the academic archaeologist is always time-space shifting. We might have tasks to finish every day, but often those activities force us to occupy multiple times, spaces, scales. A bit like being in the field, except the trench is replaced by a strange assemblage of computer screen, office window and the illusion of mindful interior contemplation.But what about today? What’s specific about 26 July and how does that reflect my ongoing archaeological identity (it’s a tricky one to shake off)? My day begins at 7.30am, when I check my emails and deal with all the urgent stuff while I drink a couple of cups of coffee and oversee my son getting ready to head off to his Mathemagical Minds and Filmmaking summer courses. Today, I’m reminded that I need to update my information for the upcoming Research Excellence Framework exercise. Every 7 years (give or take) the UK engages in an extremely costly exercise that judges the value of the nation’s research outputs, impact and  institutional culture. A bit like a North American tenure process, I suppose, but rather than determining the length of a person’s employment contract, it determines the allocation of core research funding from the Government to the academic institution. My department is one of the highest performing in our Faculty and in the country so I’m lucky to have fantastic colleagues. My co-editors, Paul Graves-Brown and Rodney Harrison, and I have just finished signing off the 2nd proofs of the Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Contemporary World and I’m relieved that this beast of a book will be out in September and can be part of my REF submission. Before the day is out I need to edit and upload my contextualizing statement for my practice-as-research entry, which is a portfolio comprising video, exhibition and publication details for Guttersnipe, what now seems a very distant project.Although I often work from home, especially on days like today when it’s sunny and warm and I can make use of the wifi outside, today I’m going to UBC. That’s partly because Jonathan C H King (von Hȕgel Fellow, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge) is giving a talk at the Museum of Anthropology about ‘Ecstatic religion, modernisation, Arctic archaeology and the establishment of the Igloolik Mission in 1937′.Abstract: In  the 1930s Oblate missionary Fr. Etienne Bazin (1903-1972) established  a mission, in what is to to-day  the thriving Inuit community of Igoolik in Nunavut. In 1937, the year he moved the mission to Igloolik Bay, Bazin was given by  Inuit some 4-500 objects excavated casually from the  pre-Inuit Dorset  (pre AD 1500) site of  Awaaja. These were presented to Graham Rowley (1912-2003), Arctic advocate, explorer and administrator, who in turn donated them to the University of Cambridge. Bazin had become a missionary after a visionary experience at the age of 18; while looking at a crucifix he was told:  “leave everything behind, your family and friends, and come to Me.”  Central to Bazin’s missionary work was countering, and yet working with, analogous belief systems, both shamanism, and syncretic forms of Christianity which developed in the Eastern Arctic in the early 20th century.  This collection is well known archaeologically,  and here is discussed in its ethno-historical context for the first time. Bazin, for instance, was celebrated by Cardinal Cushing, the prelate who married the Kennedys and buried the president, in his 1942 Boston tribute to the Oblates The Battle of Hudson’s [sic] Bay. My other task for today is to complete a draft of a paper I’m writing on the University of Local Knowledge (http://ulk.org.uk), a collaboration between Knowle West Media Centre, University of Bristol, University of the West of England, Arnolfini and US artist Suzanne Lacy. As part of a much larger project, our bit of ULK was led by Prof Mike Fraser in Computer Science and I was one of the co-investigators. The aim was to take the 900 video interviews of community experts and develop an online learning resource from this, influenced by Mooc culture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) and by work I’d done on the Into the Future project (http://dedefi.ilrt.bris.ac.uk). I’m co-writing an article with Knowle West Media Centre’s Associate Director, Penny Evans, on the aesthetics, politics and ethics of the project, focusing specifically on the relationship between the video documents and website.I am very privileged to be able to work in my home town, in the unceded shared and traditional territories of the Coast Salish people. The popular refrain in Vancouver is that it’s a city with ‘no history’ and yet there’s been 10,000 years of occupation. Archaeology here, like in many places impacted by ongoing colonization, is complex and conflicted. The British Columbia context means that archaeology in an Indigenous context is only ‘officially’ archaeology when it’s pre-contact. This makes the whole idea of contemporary archaeology problematic here but I’m keen to work with others in the community to contribute to presencing the entangled pasts of descent communities and settlers as part of the archaeological narrative of the city. Archaeology is serious business here. Land claims, rights to resource extraction, hopes for a better future, community authority and de-colonization all rest on archaeological work. It’s about money, power, knowledge, ownership, the environment, sovereignty, recognition, justice. Marina La Salle (http://ubc.academia.edu/MarinaLaSalle) and Rich Hutchings (http://ubc.academia.edu/RichardHutchings) write powerfully about the ongoing (and often unrecognized) relationships between archaeology, capitalism and racism here. Their work is important and when I stop to think about my Day of Archaeology sitting in my office, the seaweed-scented breeze and the occasional hummingbird flitting by, I think about how my privilege comes about through these relationships of inequality. And all of this reminds me that while doing archaeology in the 21st-century academy is often a distracted assemblage of electronic pings into the aether, it really does still matter and I have a responsibility to attempt to account for this mattering in whatever way I can.The A Day Somewhere between Vancouver & Bristol by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Pero… ¿qué hace un sabadellense ahí? Largo de explicar pero lo intentaremos…Actualmente tengo una beca de estancia breve predoctoral AIRE-CTP. Investigo las obras de etnógrafos que se acercaron al mundo de los pastores. Intento entender cómo funcionaba la ganadería tradicional y los diferentes tipos de ganadería que había, luego los compararé con la arqueología, lo que nos ha quedado de ellos para ver si encajan o no encajan con los restos materiales que hemos encontrado. Los yacimientos que descubrimos en prospección en el Parque Nacional de Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici (Lérida).  Intento investigar la historia humana de la montaña.Aquí en Toulouse hay también un grupo que se dedica al estudio del pastoralismo de montaña en el Pirineo, y otro en Pau, también en la vertiente francesa, en el país vasco del estado francés también llamado Iparralde. En Catalunya también hay otro grupo que ha investigado en Andorra y en Nuria, lentamente la historia de esas montañas va saliendo a la luz. Tal y como la arqueología gana terreno, se van desmintiendo ciertos mitos que pesaron durante años para explicar la historia de las montañas, mitos como “frontera natural” o “región arcaica” van quedando desmontados por el peso de la evidencia científica.Desde el despacho de al lado se ve el Pirineo, en su cara norte, desde el balcón del piso de mis padres en Sabadell se ve también el Pirineo, en su cara sur. Tengo ganas de volver a esas montañas, por trabajo, por excursión… o mejor, primero por trabajo y más tarde por excursión, antes de que acabe el verano.Foto propiedad de Oriol Clavera http://oriolphoto.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/el-machupichu-del-pirineu/Buscando los restos arqueológicos de la gente que pobló las montañas. The Pastores y montañas.

"52","Aerial view of part of the monastic phase at Lyminge (8th/9th centuries AD)Hello and welcome to the contribution direct from the field in Lyminge, Kent! I’m sitting in our ex-Korean War mess tent on the edge of the excavation watching the archaeology unfold in front of me.We are an AHRC funded research project run from the University of Reading and we are undertaking open area excavation in a picturesque village in the south-east of England. Lyminge has an extensive Anglo-Saxon history and we have been working in the area since 2007.We began open area excavation in 2008-2009 and uncovered the precinct of the monastery that existed in Lyminge in the 7th-9th centuries AD. In 2010 we moved to a new area and discovered part of the pre-existing, pre-Christian royal vill at Lyminge, dating to around the 5th-7th centuries AD. Lyminge appears to have been a highly significant settlement over several centuries, and we have been uncovering some very high-status Anglo-Saxon evidence. Last year we revealed the full plan of a 21×8.5m feasting hall that dates to c.600 AD, together with datable finds in the wall trenches of the building, like the beautiful horse harness mount that dates from AD 525-575.The Lyminge excavations in 2012. The feasting hall is clearly vsible across almost the whole trench!I’m Dr Alexandra Knox and I’m the assistant director. The project is led by Dr Gabor Thomas, and we have a small full-time team thoughout the year, with Simon Maslin (Data Manager and Environmental Supervisor) and Zoe Knapp (Zooarchaeology of Lyminge PhD and Site Supervisor).A view from the spoilheap of this year’s trench – it looks like it’s empty but all the features have baked to the same colour as the natural clay!Me!It’s in the summer that we get out for six weeks and our team expands! University students and local volunteers sign up to learn field skills and join in for the season, with training provided by Rosie Cummings, our excavation manager. Roo Mitcheson (Egypt Exploration Society), Keith Parfitt (Canterbury Archaeological Trust) and Andy Macintosh (also CAT) and Ben Parker (University of Kent) complete the supervisory team and Helen Harrington runs Finds with Emily Harwood (University of Kent), her assistant. Finally, Bethany Wood (University of Reading) looks after our visitors!Lots more information about our digs over the years can be found at www.lymingearchaeology.org and throughout the dig I write a blog to record our discoveries.Today we are almost a full week in to the dig, which means that cleaning back our 30x30m trench is almostGabor uses the total station to finish laying out the grid todaycomplete. So far we haven’t begun full excavation into the features, as we open a new area each year and have to hand clean the trench after the machine has removed the topsoil to reveal the archaeology. Students and volunteers have been deployed on those areas that need extra attention and we’re starting to make sense of the series of dark shapes in the natural orange clay. The extremely hot weather has been difficult to deal with, both for those digging and for the geology – the clay bakes very hard and we have to keep watering the site. Finally the weather has turned in our favour and we are finding it much easier to dig with a few clouds and a light breeze!Rosie waters down the site so we can clean it much more easily!Today, Gabor and Roo are finishing laying out the internal grid on the site while the volunteers finish up cleaning. We can then do a full pre-excavation plan of the site today, something that isn’t absolutely necessary in terms of records, but we always like to do – it can be so helpful to go back to the pre-ex plan to compare what things looked like before you started to dig them, and to locate lost post holes! We will also begin labelling our features with context numbers so we have everything ready to begin digging into the features. As I wrote in my blog post yesterday on our own project blog, we know we already have several sunken-featured buildings and a possible timber hall, so things are looking very good for the next five weeks in terms of Anglo-Saxon archaeology.Simon arrived today and is busy digging a nice hole in the spoil heap so that he can set up his flotationCharlotte digs out the spoilheap so the flotation tank has somewhere to drain.tank and have somewhere for the water to soak away. He’s also getting the generator going for his pump, and we will be able to process our environmental samples on site. It’s great to be able to process samples on site as we get immediate feedback about the features and can adapt our strategy accordingly.Simon, Ben and Warren get the generator for the flotation tank pump sorted oWe also have a very busy Finds tent, with lots of local volunteers coming back each day to help with finds processing. We’ve had a core team of local ladies that come back year after year. Being week 1, of course, there isn’t so much to wash yet! What we do have lots of are mesolithic and neolithic flints, with a spread of these flints all over the field that we dig on, Tayne Field. While we don’t have prehistoric archaeological features, we are certainly able to interpret the site as a place frequented by mesolithic peoples who were sourcing flints and perhaps beginning to knap tools before taking them away for further use. The spring located at the head of the valley would have been an excellent source of fresh water for settlement and stopping over for many thousands of years. The Finds team are also hard at work recording the first small finds and other items coming up in the cleaning of the trench.Emily (left), Rebecca and Ben sorting out findsWe’ve got lots going on today – even filming! Steve is a local camerman and producer and has generously agreed to help us document the excavation on film. This will be part of the sit archive but could also potentially be used in any future television documentaries. Steve grabs us when we’re not expecting it and gets us to explain what we’re doing to the camera!Steve films Helen with a findI usually get a bit nervous in front of a camera but it’s all good fun and before you know it you’ve chatted away about an exciting find without worrying about the lens in front of you!It’s currently the afternoon break and everyone is off site for a well deserved cup of tea. Some great features are coming up and you can see one of the sunken-featured buildings in the photo below, which has been nicely wetted down so you can see the edges. We’re really looking forward to starting to excavated these features as they’re often full of datable finds – certainly those that we’ve found in previous seasons have had fantastic artefacts within them (you can see a few of them at www.lymingearchaeology.org/photo-gallery)The rest of the day will be spent finishing the cleaning back, planning, labelling and photographing, to say nothing of the blogging!Andy cleans back next to one of our SFBs, the rectangular dark shape in the foregroundThe Lyminge Archaeological Project: Anglo-Saxons in Kent by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"54","Last year on the Day of Archaeology I was just deciding to set up a new social enterprise using heritage resources to support community and organisational change. I didn’t have a name, I didn’t have a plan, and all the money came from my redundancy payment. Spoliers: this is neither a story of triumph or despair, I’m still building the company, I’ve done some good things but I have a long way to go. This post seems a good time to reflect on the year, think about how my work articulates with archaeology, and give a flavour of what this kind of work involves.But first a little background…I joined English Heritage in 2001 in the belief that it was a Public Heritage body. Having come to the realisation that my own interest was not enough to sustain a satisfying career, even if I could convince people to keep paying me, I thought that working at English Heritage would put me at the coal face of a socially engaged archaeology. Really.Amazingly, this was indeed what motivated many of my colleagues, And while my own work had less public engagement than I might have liked, it was a core function of the organisation. But the review of Quangos in 2011 identified a ‘duplication’ between English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund and recommended that public engagement be left to the Heritage Lottery Fund.It seemed like a good time to leave, and the cuts following the CSR changed my role further and provided an opportunity to take voluntary redundancy. Seed corn for a new venture, so much luckier than most.Where am I now?Well, my venture has a name, Heritage for Transformation. It has a blog http://heritagefortransformation.wordpress.com It has had both paying work, and voluntary engagement. And I have a huge stock of ideas for new projects, not quite matching the funds to do them.I developed a heritage programme with Goldsmith Infant school in Portsmouth, to support their merger with Brambles Nursery. The programme is designed to help the process of change management by providing perspective and a place for reflection. I worked with the school to conduct archival research, building recording and oral history. I developed and ran a successful after school club for students building on this work and created display materials for school events. Working in concert with the reconstruction schedule associated with the merger I will be developing interpretive displays for the new entrance and events associated with key moments in the building programme.I contributed to a Linaeus University project on attitudes to the Future in Heritage. This project is commissioned by the Swedish Atomic Energy Authority to establish how archaeology and heritage can contribute a long term perspective that will help them understand the long term thinking required to manage nuclear waste. I investigated and reported on what notions of the future are operating within English Heritage through documentary analysis and interviews with key staff.Collaborating with Flow Associates (http://flowassociates.com/wordpress/ ), I have led a project for the RAMM (Royal Albert Memorial Museum) in Exeter (http://www.rammuseum.org.uk ), to scope and test the market for a new online research tool for encouraging research use of their collections derived from archaeological excavation. I’ve drawn on my understanding of excavation and post-excavation resources to help shape access to resources within the museum.Now I’m developing an HLF bid to develop a smartphone App drawing on the WWI memorials of Portsmouth. In this project I am working with historian Tim Backhouse (http://www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk/index.htm) and local schools while co-ordinating contracts to reinvigorate the public engagement with the substantial body of memorials in Portsmouth.For the first year of a venture I’d have to say its a success. But there have been and are challenges beyond the financial.Firstly, there’s identity. When I worked for EH I never had to explain. Most people didn’t know what I did, but they knew who I did it for. I had voice. I had locus. Even deciding a name took the best part of 6 months. One year on and I’m proud of what I’m developing and I’m beginning to enjoy explaining.Then there’s the business development. I’ve done enough management to be confident with the admin, but marketing, sales and development are all new skills. Luckily, I’ve had the support of http://rubystarassociates.co.uk who specialise in accidental (and even reluctant) entrepreneurs.What does my Day of Archaeology look like?Mostly writing, I have a report to finish and another to edit. A fair amount of thinking, about how I can turn ideas into projects, about how to work with more partners, and about how archaeology can support change. Finally, enjoying a huge range of posts from colleagues around the world. Lovely to be part of the Day of Archaeology, it really shows the breath of work that archaeology informs and how exciting even the everyday can be.Heritage at the FeteThe Heritage for Transformation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

In return for swearing allegiance to William, Malcolm was to be given estates in Cumbria. The peace secured by the treaty was an uneasy one and in 1093 Malcolm once again invaded northern England. An arranged meeting with the new King of England, William Rufus, to settle a dispute over the Cumbrian territories failed to materialise. Malcolm left for Scotland angry and humiliated.He returned to England shortly after with an army and laid waste to Northumberland. On his way back to Scotland he was attacked by the Earl of Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, Malcolm was killed.  The way is open for the Normans!     These guys were Vikigns that did not just steal your sheep and gold.  they took your whole kingdom by one way or another…While this is happening my printer chunders out the 2012 report for Whitecastle.  -  to learn more about these sites…  and even read about them  :  http://www.rampartscotland.co.uk/A bit on me timeI get to quickly write another article on the Mesolithic hut build based on the Mount Sandel site in Ireland – Maggie edits and asks questions about my jilted missing bits style of writing…  just as well she can’t see this!I have a chat with a friend up north about a survey course I will run in October and then have a great laugh with a friend in a large company.  ah, sometimes commercial archaeology just makes you laugh, and the consultants make you cry !I promise to see about asking about some work opportunities …  it is a pleasant 30mns that leaves my face aching with laughter!Now…  where was IThe cuppa tea is now a glass of wine..  and I have some digital work to do.   -  the Version 3 google map has to replace my current contractor map.   And it is going to be good.   no really!  this time…  I will not be distracted. The Is that the time? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"57","This time last year I was finishing writing up my postgraduate degree thesis whilst panicking amongst books, AutoCAD and copious amounts of tea. As I procrastinated on twitter (after doing lots of work, of course) I avidly followed last years Day of Archaeology, wondering to myself if I’d be in a position to post anything for the next event.Fast forward a year and here I am telling you all my day in archaeology. I’m Cath Poucher and I’ve just started my new job as Archives Services Officer for English Heritage in their archives:http://www.englishheritagearchives.org.uk/This job is perfect for me as it combines my love of research, archaeology and working with the public. Although I’m very new (I only started this month) I am thoroughly enjoying it and am learning something new every day, and this for me is the most important part of any career or volunteer project. My daily life does not directly involve working in a “traditional” archaeological setting; I do not excavate or deal with physical remains on a daily basis. Nevertheless, I assist both heritage professionals and members of the public alike to carry out a variety of projects by helping them to undertake documentary research, and this is a very important part of archaeology.My day started with the usual morning check of emails and answering requests from previous enquiries I have already carried out and undertaken. A big part of my day involves carrying out research of our archival holdings on behalf of the public, whether on their house or searching for plans of a particular English Heritage property. This means that I often have to search and handle a variety of archives ranging from measured drawings and 18th and 19th century building sales catalogues to photographs. These photographs can range in date from present day to the 19th century.Today was no different to this; I have been completing research about small listed houses in Gloucestershire and searching plans and elevations of Osbourne House, Isle of Wight and Kenilworth Castle, Warwickshire. Each day is different in that I never know what I am going be doing one day to the next, and this is what makes me so passionate about what I do. In the afternoon, I contacted customers and sent out the information I had found, and answered queries about our archives. I’m still learning my job but am enjoying every minute- especially learning about different areas of England I didn’t know anything about. At the end of the day I organised visits to the archive for customers and started new enquiries, ordering some archives from our cold store. Much of our holdings is fragile and is stored in climate controlled conditions and has to be acclimatised to room temperature before it can be viewed. As this takes 24 hours, ordering in advance is essential.So this is my day in archaeology; probably not as muddy as others, but equally fascinating and I’m looking forward to many more…(Note: the words, thoughts, and opinions expressed here are entirely my own.) The Research in Archaeology – A Day in the Archives by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"58","I kicked the day off here in TOPOI Haus, Freie Universität Berlin, with further preparations for a planned joint rescue archaeology mission in Aswan, Egypt, early next year. Egypt has been facing very challenging times and while the looting of Egypt’s cultural heritage is horrific, it pales in comparison to the economic hardship and other woes people are enduring in their-to-day lives up and down the Nile Valley. So while in the short term, planning future fieldwork is filled with uncertainty, I am pressing forward in the hopes that things will improve. My heart goes out to my Egyptian colleagues and friends today especially, with more rival rallies being held and resolution seeming rather far off.This afternoon I shifted gears and continued with analysis of Reflectance Transformation Imaging data. I am finishing up some loose ends from my Marie Curie COFUND fellowship project on inscribed and decorated objects from early Egypt and Southern Mesopotamia. I am re-processing some images to see if I can improve the visualisation of surfaces with self-shadowing problems and preparing digital illustrations of others.In tandem with this work, I am annotating my processing and digital epigraphy workflows in a training document in preparation for an RTI training workshop I am organising for TOPOI affiliates (similar to the fantastic training Cultural Heritage Imaging ran for us last year). I also had a couple of phone and email exchanges with folks from the Cologne Center for eHumanities (CCeH). They are interested in following up a digital imaging workshop I co-delivered a few weeks ago with a project applying RTI to lead curse tablets in various collections around the world – an exciting prospect! The Rescue Archaeology in Egypt and Digital Image Analysis by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"60","This blog for the ‘Day of Archaeology 2013’ is about the East Cretan Peak Sanctuary publication project. We are on the lovely island of Crete where the breeze is gently rippling over the deep blue sea, clouds cluster on the peaks of the high mountains, the cicadas are chirping, the air is scented with Cretan herbs, and at night every star is visible in the velvet dark sky.Tearing ourselves away from the beauty of our surroundings, we are doing a museum study season in the Ayios Nikolaos museum. Our task is the study of thousands of small clay figurines of people and animals from the peak sanctuaries of the Cretan (Minoan) Bronze Age. The project is a collaboration of archaeologists based in both Ireland and Greece: Professor Costis Davaras (Greek Archaeological Service); Alan Peatfield (Dept of Archaeology, University College Dublin); Christine Morris (Dept of Classics, Trinity College Dublin); Brendan O’Neill (TCD/UCD) who is in charge of the Next Engine 3D scanner.The overall aim of this project is to publish the finds, especially the figurines, from the East Cretan peak sanctuaries excavated (often to save them from looting) during the 1970s by Professor Davaras, who has generously invited us to collaborate with him. For this work we are fortunate to have funding support from the Irish Research Council for 2012-13.The peak sanctuary of Prinias in Eastern CreteFor the past two weeks we have been working away – cataloguing, photographing and 3D scanning (of which more in a moment) this archaeological material, focusing first of all on the site of Prinias seen here from the road into the town of Sitia. Our day starts with a stop at the Melissa bakery for delicious chortopitas (spinach pies) and freshly brewed coffee. In the museum apotheke (store rooms) we have ample space to spread out and study the figurines – these include representations of men and women, animals large and small, including large bulls and more miniaturized animals – bovines, sheep, goats, and some more unusual creatures – horned beetles, weasels (the Cretan nifitsa) and even the occasional cat. Many of these mountain sanctuaries, including Prinias, also have miniaturized clay models of body parts – legs, arms, half bodies, swollen hands – which were offered as part of a healing cult.Female clay figurines from Prinias.All these objects were made locally and carried up the mountain, where they were left as part of the rituals performed there. It is not difficult to imagine them being somewhat like modern Greek Orthodox rituals at mountain churches (sometimes even on the very mountains where their Bronze Age ancestors had their peak sanctuaries) – activities that were social, communal, and accompanied by food, drink and much celebration. We are interested in every aspect of the figurines – technology, style, the gender and gestures/postures of the human figurines, the dazzling variety of hair and hat styles, perhaps indicators of social status or age. Cataloguing the figurines in a relational database Brendan getting the scanning underway!Alongside the standard archaeological cataloguing (in a Filemaker Pro database), we are excited to be creating 3D scans of many of the figurines. To date, we have around 150 completed scans. We plan to make these available – and so make Minoan figurines much better known to the wider public – on a website, to complement the more conventional printed publication. The 3D models show off the complexity and character of the figurines more effectively than photographs. The scans also capture subtle details of modeling and can help us to study how the figurines are made. For this latter task, we have also explored making our own Minoan-style figurines – enlisting the help of keen students in Dublin, and, last week, the students on the Priniatikos Pyrgos field school, whom Brendan instructed in the mysteries of making figurines from local Cretan clay. Where there is a 3D model there can also be a 3D print; we have a few sample printed models, and hope to expand on this further for educational use.Our Prinias cat head being scanned Results of the scan of a male figurine from Prini Some samples of our scanning work are available on Youtube:And: The East Cretan peak sanctuary project by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"61","Upwich brine pit, Droitwich. © Copyright Chris AllenWe went to live in a salt town in Britain that was famous in antiquity, but in the 1950′s there was nothing to show for it. I began to write about it for local journals and take photographs of the Changing Face of Droitwich from glass negatives taken at the turn of the century, paintings and lithographs that historically documented the history of the town. I discovered that the brine springs (source of the salt) there was exceptional, often compared to the Dead Sea. But they are only the same as far as density of the brine is concerned, they are not the same in their mineral composition. The Dead Sea contains a number of minerals, some undesirable – whereas Droitwich brine is virtually saturated with sodium chloride. The yield of pure salt was so high the brine was divided into shares that were valued much like land. One share 6912 gallons yielding 8 tons of salt.The town was changing in the 1960′s and an old Brindley Canal excavated in 1756, had been filled in during the war. It was now being re-dug but on a slightly different line and the Brine Pit was now threatened. I stepped in and persuaded authorities to save the pit and got involved in Archaeology.The only evidence we have worldwide of a prehistoric salt industry takes the form of ‘briquetage’, massive deposits of these ceramics are found at salt sites worldwide. In 1973 I visited a number of continental salt sites, one still behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Germany and returned with samples that I showed to archaeologists at Birmingham University who were unfamiliar with them. I asked them to look out for these ceramics at the site of the three brine springs at Droitwich, and six months later they found these deposits dated to the Late Bronze Age. I predicted there were much larger deposits at the main pit – and these also were found in the late 1980′s when I founded a Charitable Trust to safeguard the site. I am now working on a paper regarding similar ceramics found in Mesopotamia in the 4th mbc and am working with the local community at Droitwich as well as government authorities in Worcestershire to establish a salt museum at the site – for which we hope to raise money so that we can put that site on the map universally.Beatrice HopkinsonHon.

Un evento de recreación histórica en el que los habitantes de la vieja Astúrica Augusta se transforman en astures y romanos con el ánimo de pasarlo bien y de hacer suyo el importante patrimonio arqueológico que alberta esta zona en relación con la Edad del Hierro y la Romanidad. Actividades de este tipo son a mi juicio fundamentales para nuestra disciplina. Es necesario que los arqueólogos y las arqueólogas nos mostremos accesibles y cercanos a nuestros conciudadanos en relación con el desarrollo de nuestras investigaciones.

Por un lado, la excavación del poblado de la Edad del Hierro de El Castru avanza a buen ritmo, y los hallazgos están siendo muy interesantes. Fundamentalmente, la buena conservación de los materiales óseos nos facilita realizar un gran avance en el conocimiento de las prácticas ganaderas de los grupos indígenas cantábricos, tema poco tratado aún por los especialistas. Además, el reconocimiento de un área metalúrgica para el trabajo del bronce adosada a la muralla, constituye una gran noticia para el proyecto. Al mismo tiempo, un grupo de compañeros y compañeras trabaja en el entorno de la iglesia parroquial de San Pedro de Vigaña, con el ánimo de reconocer las fases de ocupación de una necrópolis medieval que habíamos localizado ya en 2011. Por último, también estamos realizando pequeños sondeos en distintos sitios de la aldea para documentar mejor la secuencia ocupacional de esta localidad, algunos de los cuales están ofreciendo sorpresas importantes.Nuestro proyecto de investigación, anclado en la Arqueología del Paisaje, pretende ofrecer una lectura de tiempos largos en relación con la genealogía del paisaje en esta área de montaña. Así, nuestro grupo de trabajo acoge investigadores centrados en distintos períodos cronológicos que abordan el estudio de yacimientos que se datan entre el Neolitico y la actualidad. También convergen especialistas de distintas disciplinas, como antropólogos, especialistas en patrimonio, historiadores y arqueólogos.El día lo hemos cerado con la visita del Director General de Patrimonio del Principado de Asturias, que ha querido conocer los avances de nuestras investigaciones, ya que las últimas semanas hemos obtenido cierta trascendencia en la prensa regional y estatal. No es mala señal ésta en los tiempos que corren, pues los brutales recortes en investigación y desarrollo que se han impuesto desde el gobierno central amenazan con paralizar el proyecto en próximas campañas, por lo que es muy necesario implicar al máximo número de apoyos e instituciones para que nuestro proyecto pueda continuar. Y para terminra, en escasos diez minutos, comenzará en Belmonte de Miranda la última sesión del ciclo de charlas y debates que hemos organizado en paralelo a nuestra excavación. La mesa redonda de hoy servirá para debatir sobre aspectos varios de la ganadería y enlazar los resultados de nuestras investigaciones con las problemáticas a las que se enfrentan los ganaderos actuales en el valle del Pigüeña.La braña de L’estoupiel.lu, en los pastizales de altura que se elevan sobre la aldea de Vigaña.The Arqueología del Paisaje en Vigaña (Asturias, España) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"63","Angela Gannon, RCAHMS at the viewfinder on top of Cockleroy Hill‘If you’re not fast, you’re last’ is one of the choice phrases I, Angela Gannon, routinely hear from my two sons as I invariably end up sitting in the back of the car having been beaten to the front passenger seat … again! So it is too that in the list of Scottish council areas for the Day of Archaeology, my first to third choices had already been selected by colleagues. But should West Lothian really be number four in my list anyway? Well, of course not. As one of RCAHMS’ archaeological field investigators, and living just outside West Lothian, I have spent many a Sunday afternoon visiting sites and monuments here, from the cairn and henge on Cairnpapple Hill to the lesser known fort that crowns the summit of Cockleroy Hill.West Lothian ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’It is the latter that I want to champion today because, despite the regular procession of visitors traipsing to the top, I suspect it is only a small percentage who recognise the fort – even though the well-worn path they follow to the summit passes through the original entrance. Situated on the boundary of Beecraigs Country Park, the path leads walkers to the viewpoint on the top, and on a clear day you can see Ben More, near Crianlarich, 74km (46 miles) to the north west, Goat Fell on Arran 106km (66 miles) to the west-southwest and Black Hill in the Scottish Borders 53km (33 miles) to the southeast – or at least that’s what the directional arrows on the viewfinder lead us to believe. Over to Fife are the hills of Dumglow and East Lomond, both with forts on their summits, and to the east the profiles of the Bass Rock and North Berwick Law are readily recognisable. We ourselves have visited Cockelroy on many occasions and under very different conditions – in shorts and T-shirts in March to wellies and waterproofs in July. And, yes, I haven’t got the months mixed up!The outer face of the lower rampart. Copyright Angela GannonThe fort has much to commend it. As a prominent and conspicuous hill, it occupies a commanding position in the landscape, overlooking Linlithgow and Grangemouth with fine views north over the Firth of Forth. Its perimeter is defined by a stone rampart that follows the leading edge of the summit with stretches of stone inner and outer faces still visible. From this we can tell that the rampart was originally about 2m thick and had an earth and rubble core. On the west and southwest, the ground drops precipitously but on the northwest it falls more gently and here the fort is defended by an additional line of defence. This too takes the form of a stone faced rampart. Alongside the viewfinder and the Ordnance Survey triangulation station within the interior of the fort, four ring ditch houses were recorded in 1985, but I have yet to visit the site and be convinced. Perhaps under better lighting conditions and with a more positive ‘eye of faith’ I might see them.Looking west along the north section of the upper rampart. Copyright Angela GannonSo next time you venture up Cockleroy remember to look down – the archaeology is there at your feet. But in the meantime, do have a look at our site record for the fort  including the oblique aerial photographs taken under snow.There are also some great kite aerial photographs taken by Jim Knowles of the West Lothian Archaeology Group which are well worth a look too: http://www.armadale.org.uk/cockleroy.htmThis is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Angela Gannon (RCAHMS) – West Lothian by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"64","There are many kinds of archaeologist – some are specialized in a region or on a period others do contract archaeology, surveys, work at museums, laboratories or work with planning issues etc etc. We do many many things. We do archaeology!I’ve done it all – more or less: I’m an osteolgist so I do the odd osteolgical analysis. I’m an archaeologist so I’ve done surveys, contract archaeology, research archaeology and currently I work at the County board of Östergöland in Sweden doing what could be called planning archaeology.Osteology, mesolithic skeleton, Övra Wannborga, Öland, SwedenSo what is planning archaeology? Well lets say it’s a form of archaeological desk-based assessments – what kind of archaeology is needed in a certain situation – for example when someone wants to build a road or house. In Sweden the County boards are responsible for this part, we also order the archaeology and then let the developer pay for it – sounds sweet, it has its ups and downs. Of course I can’t just decide from the top of my head, the decisions are made according to law and praxis.This is how it works in Sweden, in three easy (or not) steps!Step one. Person A, the developer, submitting a notification that he or she is planning a development of some sorts. The County Board will make an assessment concerning if there are archaeological needs, based on archaeological records, previous digs, historical maps and other studies. If we find that we don’t have enough knowledge to make a decision or if the data points to the likelihood that one may encounter ancient remains – then we order a preliminary archaeological investigation.Ismantorp ancient fortress, Öland, SwedenDuring a preliminary archaeological investigation an archaeological contractor, a museum or other arhaeological institution of the County board’s choice is choosen. They do a review of historical sources, archaeological material as well as a survey (field walking) and, if necessary, do search trenches.Excavation 2010, Västra Götaland, SwedenBased on the information from the preliminary archaeological investigation we then either say that archaeology in some form is needed or not.Step two. If needed the next step in the process is an archaeological investigation. During this the ancient monument is to be defined geographically, decide its function, be dated and its scientific potential should be described. For this a limited archaeological excavation is needed. The result should give us the information needed to decide if the final step is needed, a full archaeological excavation, but also facts enough for others to be able to make an excavation plan and a cost estimate.Excavation, Blekinge, Sweden 2011Step three. The final step, if needed, is a full excavation, meaning the ancient monument is to be removed and documented. If this cost is under 890 000 Swedish crowns, ca: 104000 Euro, the County Board can decide who will do the archaeology, if it costs more it needs to be procured.In most cases the developer has to pay for all archaeology. Among the various steps in the process the developer can of course choose to cancel the archaeological process (and stop the development), they also aim to give the developer the opportunity to look at other opportunities or changes to lower thier costs. In the end the less archaeology being made the better we do our jobs – as the intention is to preserve monuments rather than make them disappear – a kind of archaeological paradox, wouldn’t you say.A lot of what I do is this – is that boring?- No, it actually is quite interesting and in many cases complex, and you get to learn new things along the way. I never thought I’d be doing make procurements when I studied archaeology, and by the way I wasn’t taught how to either!Rock art, Hästholmen, Östergötland, SwedenIs this all that we do? No we do lots of other things concerning cultural heritage, such as signs at ancient monuments, small surveys, projects, meeting land owners, forest owners, looking into environments and landscapes etc. But when the sun shines outside I can feel the trowel luring me, but then again when its rainy/snowy, cold and/or wet it’s quite good to be sitting inside – looking out Winter dig Sweden 2010Magnus Reuterdahl, an archaeologist at the County Adminstrative board Östergötland, Sweden and blogging at Testimony of the spade. The ABC of Swedish planning archaeology and an archaeological paradox by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"66","The logo of the Arkansas Archeological Survey. Click here to find out more about our organization.My name is Jamie Brandon and I work for the Arkansas Archeological Survey (AAS). Last year, the 2012 Day of Archaeology caught me finishing up a large excavation I was directing at Historic Washington State Park.  This kind of thing (directing excavations) is what the public might expect an archaeologist to do.  This year, however, the 2013 Day of Archaeology is in July, and for me, July is all about winding up my fiscal year which runs from July 1 through June 30.  So, late every July you will find me writing a summary of my last year’s work—this will eventually find its way into an annual report which is a major document that we provide to the public and lawmakers to explain what it is the AAS does and why it is important to Arkansans.  This may seem on the surface to be bureaucratic and boring, but, in fact, it is an excellent opportunity to give you an idea not only what I do in a single day, but what my life as an archaeologist looks like throughout the year—the width and breath of what it is we do at the Arkansas Archeological Survey.  I call it “A Year in a Day.”The Arkansas Archeological Survey is an organization whose mission is to “conserve and research the state’s heritage and communicate this information to the public.”  What this means is that I do quite a number of different things in the course of my job.  I teach, work with graduate students and conduct research (like most university-based, academic archaeologists), but I also am responsible for helping to manage archaeological resources in my assigned research territory (11 counties in southwest Arkansas), working with groups of volunteers and doing public outreach about what we do…that’s a lot of hats for one job.Research, Fieldwork and PublicationsLet’s start with the parts of my job that most people expect—doing archaeological research and fieldwork.  As I just finished up directing two field seasons at the aforementioned Historic Washington State Park, I tried to take this year easy…but as I sit down to write my annual report, I find that I was not very successful.We conducted a series of “long weekend” digs in the fall at a site called Dooley’s Ferry, a Civil War-era community that was a major, early crossing on the Red River.  I say “we” as this project was actually the dissertation topic of my research assistant, Carl Drexler.  You can read Carl’s Day of Archaeology post (including a little bit about Dooley’s Ferry) here.  Our work at Dooley’s Ferry, however, points out two things.  First it indicates that even the categories that I use in this blog post are problematic—I could have easily placed this project under “Teaching and Working with Graduate Students.”  Second, it reminds me to mention the importance of volunteers in our work at the AAS.  Last year my Day of Archaeology post was about the Arkansas Archeological Society, the volunteer organization that helped lobby the AAS into existence in the late 1960s.  We work continually with the Society on projects all around the state and I would not truly be able to do my job without them.  Over 51 volunteers helped out in our Dooley’s Ferry work.  We worked with the landowners, retired mill workers, foresters, archivists, biology instructors, nurses at correctional facilities, software engineers and even folks who own a hardware store—folks from all walks of life…If these folks had not volunteered their time and effort, we would have not found out all that we did at the site.Arkansas Archeological Society volunteers digging at Dooley’s Ferry last fall.The second field project we were part of this year was also a graduate student project.  John Samuelsen, a Ph.D. student at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, is working on collecting remote sensing data at Crenshaw, an important prehistoric Caddo Indian site in my research territory.  John, Carl and I—along with a number of our colleagues and volunteers—collected 387 twenty-meter-square grids of data during two field efforts at the site (one in July and one in the fall).  What is “remote sensing,” you ask?  Remote sensing means using a suite of high-tech methods (such as ground penetrating radar or magnetometery) to get a look at what might be under the ground before we dig…or on ceremonial sites, like Crenshaw, to get a look at what might be beneath the surface without disturbing sacred deposits.  Remote sensing is an increasingly important component of the technical and methodological tool set available in archaeological research, and I’m proud that, despite stereotypes about the state being backward, the University of Arkansas and the AAS are at the leading edge of these methods.As far as publications go, I got two peer-review publications through major hoops and hurtling towards publication this year—one for a thematic volume of Historical Archaeology, the international journal of my sub-discipline…and the other a chapter in an edited volume on historical archaeology in Arkansas.  The former should be published by the end of the year, the latter has gotten through review and we hope to receive a book contract early this fall (*fingers crossed*).Additionally, I also did two book reviews this year.  I reviewed Buying into a World of Goods: Early Consumers in Backcountry Virginia by Ann Smart Martin for (of all places) Enterprise and Society: The International Journal of Business History and I reviewed Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past by Julia King for American Antiquity.  I personally think book reviews are underrated academically…not for resume padding (although some people do that)…but for my own professional development.  One of the things I miss about graduate school is the amount of reading and synthesizing of information that you do on a regular basis.  I find accepting book review projects as a good way to force myself to keep up with literature and really digest it (I have to write about something before I fully understand and integrate its content).Teaching & Working with Graduate StudentsThe second most commonly thought of aspect in the life of an academic archaeologist is teaching.  As a part of my job I teach the anthropology curriculum at my host institution, Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia—this year that means that I taught General Anthropology (ANTH/SOC 1003) and Anthropology of North American Indians (ANTH/SOC/HIST 3143).  I teach anthropology and archaeology on a campus that does not have an anthropology major.  This means that, in all likelihood, my classes may be the only anthropology class a student ever has. The impression I give a student is the one that he or she is going to carry for a big hunk of their lives—I had better make anthropology relevant and interesting. In this situation I feel that it is not my job to get incredibly technical about my field (as I would do with majors), but simply to make sure that my students understand what anthropology is, what questions anthropology is interested in asking and how it goes about answering those questions. If students leave my class with an appreciation for the diversity of human culture (and they have improved their critical thinking skills), I have succeeded.Teaching art students about prehistoric ceramics at Southern Arkansas University.I get more technical (and philosophical) in my role working with graduate students from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and elsewhere—the future of our discipline.  I am proud that this year two of the graduate students I’ve been working with on projects in my research territory have completed their Ph.D. dissertations.  In April, Duncan McKinnon successfully defended his dissertation at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.  I’ve been working with Duncan on the Caddo site of Battle Mound in Lafayette County since 2007—his work combined new technologies (that remote sensing stuff again) and the reanalysis of old collections from the site.  His dissertation, entitled Battle Mound: Exploring Space, Place, and History of a Red River Caddo Community in Southwest Arkansas, is a major contribution to Caddo archaeology and the archaeological literature of southwestern Arkansas.In May, my current research assistant, Carl Drexler (mentioned above) was successful in his defense of his Ph.D. dissertation at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA.  Carl’s dissertation, entitled Dooley’s Ferry: The Archaeology of a Civilian Community in Wartime, was based on 6 years’ worth of archaeology here in southwestern Arkansas using resources and staff from the Arkansas Archeological Survey and volunteers from the Arkansas Archeological Society.  Carl’s work reconstructed the footprint of Dooley’s Ferry and explored the ways that this community was impacted by the Civil War.Public Outreach and Professional ServiceThis is where my job with the AAS departs from that of a typical academic archaeologist.  One of my favorite parts of my job is that doing public outreach is valued by my organization.  I gave 22 public talks this year on archaeology around the state—that averages to almost two every month.  This includes talks to chapters of our volunteer organization (I gave 5 of those) as well as community groups as diverse as Rotary clubs, genealogical and historical societies, museum groups, state parks and local chapters of the DAR…I even gave a talk about the archaeology of religion to the Hot Springs Freethinkers!Giving public talks is the favorite part of my job as an AAS Research Station Archeologist.In addition to these formal talks, I also consulted with private landowners in four counties (Little River, Sevier, Union and Hempstead) about objects found on their property…and I provided advice and assistance to the South Arkansas Historical Foundation (about preservation efforts at Bethel Methodist Church in Mt. Holly, Union County), Historic Washington State Park (about preservation efforts at Pioneer Washington Cemetery, Hempstead County), Southern Arkansas University (Alumni concerns about the preservation of a Mosasaur fossil on display at SAU in Magnolia, Columbia County…yes, I KNOW archaeologists do NOT do dinosaurs…but what are you going to do?…), EAST Lab at Dierks High School (about cemetery preservation efforts in Dierks, Howard County), the Historic Arkansas Museum (Funerary art for the Arkansas Made Project), and several consultations with the Mapping the Legacy of African American History, LLC (about a West Ninth Street mapping project in Little Rock, Pulaski County).Most academics spend some amount of time on professional service—serving on conference committees and whatnot.  I spend quite a bit of time in this arena…why?  Because I feel that in this part of my job I can make “things happen”…I can help shape public policy, help put on a conference, help research get published and, thus, get shared with the community at large, or help save a historic place…On the state-level, I serve on the boards of the Arkansas Historical Association (AHA) and the Historic Preservation Alliance of Arkansas (HPAA).  Positions like this afford us the opportunities to get tangible results from our work.  For instance, this year I was the conference chair for the AHA Conference in Helena, AR—making all the arrangements for a state-level conference in a town without a hotel, no major conference venue and only a single restaurant…talk about challenging.  It was a lot of time and energy, but in the end (thanks to the help of the Delta Cultural Center), it was incredibly rewarding to see the conference come off as a success.  Similarly, I served on the HPAA committee which names “Arkansas Most Endangered Historic Places”—a list that is meant to call public attention and, hopefully resources, to the sites that most need saving in the state.  Two of the seven properties that we listed this year (the Roundtop Filling Station and St. Joseph’s Orphanage) have made great strides toward stabilization, obtaining much needed support, and planning for future renovation/adaptive use.  That is gratifying work indeed.I am also the Vice-Chairman of the Arkansas Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission and I serve on the State Review Board for Historic Preservation (the state body that recommends properties for listing on the National Register of Historic Places).  In these roles I feel that I really (or I should say, more directly) make a difference—helping constituents get their property listed on the National or Arkansas Register of Historic Places, helping local communities and organizations get grants for commemorative events, or historic markers, that tell that community’s local story…even consulting with and educating others in state government about policy issues…this, too, makes me feel like my job matters.You’ll notice that all of the above mentioned service roles are not specifically archaeology-oriented…When I serve in these capacities I’m still doing an outreach of sorts…educating other professionals—historians, architects, planners, historic preservationists, and law makers—about what archaeologists do and why they should care.  But I also do service within my sub-disciple of historical archaeology.  I am an Associate Editor of Historical Archaeology (I shepherded three articles to publication this year) and the Chair of the Academic and Professional Training Committee of the Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA).  In these roles I get to do things like help the SHA get into modern social media, coordinate workshop for professional development, and chair the SHA Student Paper Prize (which I have chaired for the last 6 years)…giving young, outstanding scholars in my field recognition (and over $1500 in books)…it doesn’t get more rewarding than that…ConclusionSo there it is:  a year of what I do with the Arkansas Archeological Survey (well, actually, there is still more that I left out)…as seen through my annual report.  I think it gives you a bigger picture than the “day” snapshot that I normally blog about.Ok…ok…ok…reading back over this blog post as I write, it seems way too self-promoting…that’s NOT what I’m trying to do…Likewise, I know that this blog post seems to ramble in various and sundry directions…but that IS the point, actually—my job as an archaeologist with the Arkansas Archeological Survey is not a simple job.  In truth, it is more like three jobs…1) that of a typical academic anthropology professor; 2) that of an public outreach coordinator for archaeology and; 3) that of a state agency official responsible for managing cultural resources in my territory.  This is challenging…But if I were to leave the AAS and become a more “typical” academic archaeologist I would miss these other aspects of my job, and I would probably still do some of them (such as public outreach)…the only difference is that they would not be specifically part of my job per se…or would at least not be as appreciated as they are with the AAS.  I appreciate that my organization lets me do all of these things in the name of archaeology…It’s a whole lot of a job…..but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Want to keep up with what we’re up to?Follow my personal blog, Father Along, at: http://fartheralong.wordpress.com/…or take a look at the AAS web page, the AAS-SAU Research Station website, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or Flickr…The A Year In a Day:  My Life as an Arkansas Archeological Survey Archeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"67","This day of archaeology is somewhat typical for me. I specialize in the analysis of human and animal bones (humans are animals after all). Today’s work involves taking a look at an Egyptian mummy and packing up approximately 2,000 animal bones for shipment.Mummies are a relatively common component of art museum collections. Back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, museums built their artifact collections by buying objects with little concern over how they were acquired by dealers. Mummies and their sarcophagi (cases) could be purchased individually or as a pair. Ethics have greatly changed since then and such transactions are now rare.The mummy I went to see is in storage at the Vassar art museum. My goal was not to conduct any scientific study of the mummy, it was simply to evaluate the potential to use it as part of my introductory archaeology course in the fall. The mummy is in very good condition, which means that anyone expecting to clearly see an arm, leg, or face will be disappointed. This will allow my class to discuss where their fascination with archaeology lies – do they simply want to see something that is macabre or do they have a genuine interest in understanding the past? For those with a genuine interest, this mummy presents a challenge in that it is both easy and difficult to learn more about it.A simple Google search will produce several different stories about the mummy, each coming from what seems to be a reputable source. This is one of the greatest challenges archaeology professors face – how do we teach our students to search for the best answer since there is often no single right answer about the past. For example, one Vassar source says the mummy is Swty-Hetep, a priestess of Isis from 200 BC. Another Vassar source says the mummy is Shep-en-Min, the son of a chantress who died in his late teens around 600 BCE. A third Vassar source says the mummy is Shep-en-min who was a priest involved in rituals for the god Min. His age is placed at 25 to 30 years old and cause of death may have been a fracture of his right leg. The more recent analyses of the mummy are likely more reliable than the older ones as technology has allowed researchers to look under the wraps without unwrapping him. A video showing how this was done can be found on YouTube and a newspaper article is at the local newspaper site.  These boxes contain approximately 2,000 fragments of animal boneAs a North American archaeologist I have no special expertise in mummy analysis nor do I have a great interest in mummies. But students and most non-archaeologists expect me to talk about mummies so I do. I am more interested in understanding the past of people who lived in the same places that my students and I live.Currently, I am finishing up a report on animal bones recovered from sites in Nevada. As a faunal analyst, other archaeologists send the bones they recover to me for specialized study. I identify the bones and then interpret them and mail them back along with a report.These bones are helping those who excavated the site to understand what some stone circles or rock rings were used for. As with the mummy, there are various ways of interpreting these features and additional data helps to create a more reliable interpretation.  In archaeology we are always refining our understanding of the past using new tools. Some are high tech like CT scans. Others are low tech like using the complete skeletons of known animals to identify tiny fragments of animal bones recovered during excavation.These animal skeletons are used to identify the fragments of bone recovered during excavation.The Museum Mummy and Boxes of Animal Bone by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

My year at the Commission is split between different parts of RCAHMS’ work (Scran, social media, a university module, etc), as well as an external three-month placement. My placement was itself split between Stirling Castle and the Bannockburn Heritage Centre. I’ve chosen the undiscovered site of the second day of the battle of Bannockburn. The battle itself was a pivotal moment in Scottish history, which combines elements of mythology as much as fact. The physical remains of the battle, however, are almost non-existent; thus far, a single 14th-century arrowhead has been found, which may not be linked to the battle in any case. There is no doubt that the battle of 1314 CE took place somewhere around today’s Bannock burn, but frustratingly efforts by archaeologists and metal detectors to locate any evidence in the ground have been unsuccessful.Since the battle, the area between the Pelstream and Bannock burns (where it is considered the second day of the clash took place) has been used as a ploughed field and dump site for building waste from different periods. Today, the area is largely wild grass, sitting between 20th-century suburban housing and the railway line from Edinburgh to Stirling.View of the Big Dig. Copyright Aisha Al-SadieI’ve chosen the undiscovered battlefield because it represents the challenge to historians and archaeologists in determining the developments on the ground during this critical day in Scottish history. It has also recently been the focus of a Big Dig in June 2013, which saw fantastic community involvement aimed at establishing the site of the second day’s battle. Part of the activities on the site was filmed for an upcoming TV show produced to celebrate the 700-year anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn.Filming the Big Dig, with Tony Pollard and Neil Oliver.

We try to say something about people by examining the things they manufactured and used (artifacts) and that we today, find in the ground. In order to understand the meaning behind the artifacts, we need to understand the culture of those who made them, to do this we work with local First Nations populations. The learners people enrolled in this program have learned to replicate the technologies that produce the artifacts that are often discovered in our area (such as stone tools and pottery). The goal of this was to better understand a bit more about the people who had lived and manufactured such items in the distant past, and the processes by which the archaeological record is formed. This is known as experimental archaeology.The program is held on a dedicated area on the UNB campus year after year and students learn excavation techniques in the space used in the previous year where the “experimental technology” has occurred. Through these exercises, participants can learn appropriate excavation and recovery techniques that would be used in a “real life” archaeological field situation. This simulation allows students to experience “hands on learning” without raising ethical implications that could arise from teaching students on a true archaeological site. I compare it to learning to fly with a computer simulator prior to taking a plane out for the first time.Students this year have completed the course with the guidance of Mi’kmaq and Wolastoqiyik Elders and craft specialists. They have flint knapped, made pottery, constructed a wigwam and learned the craft of basket-making. Students also learned how to create a grid and map an archaeological site. There was a focus on the importance of maintaining accurate field notes, careful trowelling and sifting dirt, and recording the location of artifacts. We worked outside in most weather conditions, just as if we would be expected to do if we were “in the field.” Most importantly, learners found a new appreciation for the objects left by those who inhabited the distant past in the teachings shared with them by the Elders.Today, we spent the day reflecting on all we have learned and come to appreciate about archaeology. One student shared that this program “really hit home the thankless work of archaeologists, I know have a great respect for them after doing all the hard labour involved in a dig…but that by recording such matters we can understand that a vibrant nation once lived here well among the many rivers and streams of New Brunswick.”The The Archaeology Summer program at UNB Fredericton by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"71","After the site visit this morning, I’ve spent the afternoon at my desk at home writing up part of a chapter of my PhD and deciding what I’m going to blog about in my weekly post. I set up http://medievalparksgardensanddesignedlandscapes.wordpress.com/ to be able to write about experience of PhD research, or research which I’d like to incorporate into my PhD, but for one reason or other probably won’t find a home there. So tonight (I usually do this on a Sunday but this week I won’t be able to) I’ll post up my latest thoughts.The part of my chapter I have been working on concerns north west Shropshire, which has been included in my study area because it shares very similar topography with north east Wales, but has been under ‘different’ ownership and government for hundreds of years. Within this area are three medieval deer parks which are all within a few miles of each other, and which are all almost identical in size at about 0.3 hectares. I’m not sure why this is yet, but I spent the afternoon looking at the available maps and aerial photographs trying to identify any common characteristics and pattern in their layout. It’s the hardest part of my research, but when I get it right it’s very rewarding.Finally, I was overjoyed to see that the research and excavation project being run by a fellow PhD student had made it onto the BBC Wales news website. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-23458968Mark Baker has been working on establishing a chronology for the medieval and post medieval house at Brynkir (Longitude 52.969888; Latitude -4.201307). As part of my own research I identified a medieval deer park just to the south east of the house, and realised it related to a motte and bailey castle at Dolbenmaen (Longitude 52.964195; Latitude -4.225157) some  1.5km (0.9 miles) west.The Park at Brynkir. The elongated oval in the centre of the picture marked in red is the park, and the house is in the trees to the top left of the park boundary.Subsequently Mark and I agreed that an excavation of the boundary of the deer park would be incorporated in his research excavation this coming August, and my final job of the day has been to ring the BBC journalist in order to arrange to be interviewed on site talking about this discovery.As I said this morning – the joy of archaeology is you never know what is going to happen next. So, if you are reading about the exploits of archaeologists for the first time or have come to this website to find out more, I hope we’ve all been able to inspire you into finding out more about our discipline. The Castles and Crowdfunding – Part Two by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"72","Hi everyone I’m Heather Sebire, Property Curator for English Heritage in the west of England. My day started with the usual early morning checking of emails and then I paid a site visit to Gloucester Blackfriars which is in EH guardianship. It is one of the most complete surviving friaries of the Dominican  ’back friars’ in the country  and we have recently undertaken work to enable more of the buildings to be used for concerts and other performing arts. It was magical as there was a rehearsal going on for the Three Choirs festival in the church itself and one almost expected to see the friars appearing at any minute in the cloister.www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/gloucester-blackfriarsThat was followed by a real treat. I visited Arthur’s stone neolithic burial chamber near Bredwardine in Herefordshirewww.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/arthurs-stoneand then went on to visit the excavations at Dorstone led by Professor Julian Thomas from Manchester University and County Archaeologist Dr Keith Ray. This exciting excavation has revealed large post holes from a neolithic building and a serious of cists which appear to be associated with a long mound. Among the finds were a beautiful polished stone axe, a polished flint axe and a beautiful flint knife. Here is Julian Thomas holding the flint knife.There is an open day at the site on Sunday 28th (there is a Facebook page I understand).Tony Fleming, recently retired Inspector of Ancient Monuments with EH was also there visiting (looking very relaxed) with his wife.

"74","“To manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas and to provide hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.” – Texas Parks and Wildlife Mission Statement.After almost 9 years working for a private environmental consulting firm, I recently joined the Archeology (that’s the official spelling here) Survey Team for the State Parks division of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. It’s a great career opportunity, a promotion and a raise, and involves less travel (and shorter stints), all of which were very appealing to me as I get older and want to settle down a bit.Here I am, recording a rockshelter site for my new job!But what I really like about my new job is encapsulated in our mission statement above: “manage and CONSERVE the…cultural resources of Texas.” After all, the “M” in CRM stands for “management”. I work for the people of Texas, as a steward of public lands, to help protect (manage) and conserve the archaeological record of this state.The nuts and bolts of the job aren’t much different than private sector CRM. My coworkers and I conduct archaeological surveys of existing and proposed State Parks and State Natural Areas, where we identify and assess cultural resources (primarily, but not necessarily limited to, archaeological sites). We walk transects, we dig holes, we identify and sometimes collect artifacts, we note previous natural and artificial impacts to the sites, assess the integrity of the deposits and the potential research value. Often, this is project specific work; if a park wants to develop a new series of trails, or expand a campground, there’s a survey beforehand.One of the many stark, beautiful views from the canyons of the Lower Pecos region of TexasRecently, we have been surveying a new, not-yet-opened, property in the Lower Pecos. We are helping the park planners determine where campsites, roads, and trails can be placed to have minimal impacts on cultural resources, while also allowing our park guests the opportunity to experience and explore the area. This is also something we must consider in our work, as high visibility sites (such as rockshelters, structures, and large burned rock middens) will certainly draw attention and visits, even if they’re not in the immediate impact areas. In fact, one of the criteria we use in evaluating sites is potential for vandalism (a sad, unfortunate fact of life).Our work doesn’t stop with the planning of the park. One of the things we do is develop a cultural resources management plan for the park rangers and superintendents. This may involve a regular visit to some of the sites (the time frames differ, depending on the significance and visibility), limiting access to extremely sensitive areas (a last resort), or doing nothing. We thoroughly document the sites with maps and photographs to assist with the monitoring.We also help with interpretation. In our reports, we try and tell the “story” of the park. We are fortunate to have access to broad yet constrained areas for our studies, as opposed to the long, narrow, linear surveys so common these days in CRM. We also have the luxury of time to do background research and analyses that can help us in our understanding of the parks; after all the resources are being protected (although our budgets are certainly not unlimited). Finally, we (as an office, it’s not really part of my job) can develop interpretative displays and materials for the parks, so that the guests can also know the story of the park, and appreciate some of the resources. We are always learning and thinking of new ways to do this.So that’s what I do, in general. What am I doing today, on the Day of Archaeology? I’m working on a report for a survey done at Bastrop State Park following the devastating wildfires of September 2011. Right now, I’m finishing chapters on the artifact analysis and the sites that were recorded. Eventually, I will be bringing in the information from all of the previous work done in the park to tell the story of the park. I’m not even sure what that is just yet, but I’m looking forward to finding out.(note: the words, thoughts, and opinions expressed above are mine alone, and do not represent the official words or policies of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, except where explicitly quoted)The Surveying Texas parks, where life’s better outside! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"75","South Lanarkshire ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Early Stone Castles of South Lanarkshire I have been working as an Archaeological Investigator for RCAHMS since 1989 and currently as an Operations Manager in Survey and Recording. As a medievalist I have long been interested in castles in all their variety wherever they occur from Scotland to Greece, but opportunities for me to record and research them for RCAHMS only became available in 2000 with the Donside survey that led to the publication of In the Shadow of Bennachie (2007). This showed me that we have a lot to learn about the origin and development of castles, with a rash of motte-like structures, including the dramatic castle of Invernochty, Strathdon, with its ‘later’ stone curtain wall built by the ‘native’ earl of Mar, not all of which were medieval castles at all. Baileys, usually part and parcel of the castle earthwork, were absent, except at the Bass of Inverurie, but the mottes were often big enough to take a range of structures. More worrying was the absence of identifiable elite structures of the immediately preceding period.View of Crawford castle from the air, showing the later stone castle on top of the motte. Copyright RCAHMS (DP153534)The origins of castles in Scotland are generally assumed to derive from the influx of Anglo-French followers of King David and his successors bringing with them their notions of what was necessary for the centre of power of a lordship. Raising an earthwork or modifying a natural mound to make a place of strength was the quickest way of achieving this. South Lanarkshire provides a good test bed for this thesis since the documentation tells us that it was settled in the 12th century by Flemish knights, some of whom established themselves by building castles based on mottes or earthworks that defy easy definition. Some like Coulter motte in the care of Historic Scotland, or Crawford castle, a motte with a later stone tower, appear to have been typical conical mounded structures, but others like the earthwork at Castle Qua just outside Lanark, or that at Cadzow, not far from the later stone castle, take the form of promontories defended by earthworks with broad external ditches.  These were sites that were rejected as prehistoric settlement enclosures by the Royal Commission investigators in the 1970s, although a Roman coin found during excavations by Lanarkshire Archaeology Society of the Cadzow earthwork suggest a late Iron Age or Dark Age date.Cadzow earthwork, showing the mound and south ditch. The old oak trees have been dated by dendrochronology to the 15th century when the site lay within a hunting park. Copyright Piers DixonFurther investigation of these sites is clearly needed. That at Castle Qua has been the focus of some interest locally and the Commission has reviewed the possibility of further survey work at the site with Addyman Archaeology for the Clyde and Avon Valley Landscape Partnership.  The site itself is a dramatic one with a cliff on one side dropping down to the Mouse Water more than 100 feet below. A substantial earthwork that displays traces of stone facings lies within broad ditch enclosing an area some 30m across with traces of structures near the cliff edge. A second ditch suggests the possibility of a bailey.Plan of Castle Qua showing the suggested line of the outer ditch as an overlay on the RCAHMS plan. (Addyman Archaeology overlay and RCAHMS DP152072)Archaeology has also thrown up spanners in the dating of mottes, for example, excavations by Chris Tabraham at Roberton motte in the 1970s produced a sherd of imported pottery from France dated to the 14th century from the base of the mound. This contradicts the established wisdom of dating the construction of mottes and other earthwork castles to the 12th and 13th centuries by incoming Flemish lords. Although there is a good correlation between the documented Flemish incomers and the eponymous villages of Roberton, Thankerton, Symington, Covington, Lamington and Wiston, for example, all settlements of potentially medieval origin,  earthwork castles have yet to be located at all of them.  There is clearly much work to be done here in understanding the development of castles and this area provides an excellent location for doing just that.Castle Qua earthwork and ditch, much overgrown.

That means things are relatively quiet, but there’s still lots to get ready for the next issue.On the CA side of things, our Editor Matt is busy getting our next set of features ready to send back to contributors. We’ve got some super stories in store for you – really looking forward to sharing them with you once CA 283 is in print! Meanwhile I’ve been setting up some news stories and keeping regular content ticking over.Back issues of CWA, which we’ve been going through in the run-up to our 10th anniversary issue.It might be a little while before the next CWA goes to the printers, but things are really buzzing on the international side of the office, as we’re working towards our 10th anniversary issue. Lots of exciting ideas bouncing around at the moment – particularly to do with the cover – I can’t wait to see how it shapes up over the next few weeks. Speaking of exciting, the latest issue of CWA has just come out in the shops – we’re really pleased with how it looks, and we hope you enjoy it too.Normally Friday is Treats Day, but alas, this week our advertising guru Mike, who normally brings the yummy things, is on holiday – but never fear, our lovely intern Polly, who’s helping out with editorial, has gallantly stepped into the breach, surprising us with some super sweeties.

"77","My name is Matt Tuttle and I work as an archaeologist in the historic Hampton Roads, Virginia area in the U.S.  This region is a wonderful area to do such work because the land has been continuously occupied by humans for millennia.  My hometown of Virginia Beach is the location of the first landing of the Virginia Company colonists in the New World before establishing themselves at Jamestown.  Not only is the first permanent English settlement in America, Jamestown (1607), located here; but neighboring Williamsburg served as the colonial capital of Virginia after Jamestown until 1779.  Under the layers of colonial occupation in Hampton Roads we also find a long prehistoric record of Native American sites.  The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and its shores have been densely populated since paleo-times.What I do as an archaeologist can vary greatly project by project and season to season.  I’ve worked for CRM (Cultural Resource Management) firms in the area for years; generally projects with these companies deal with salvage archaeology. This is where a plot of land which is slated for development or construction is surveyed and excavated to ascertain that no cultural material is being built upon or destroyed.  Lately I have been digging as an independent contractor in the area and have gotten to work on some incredible sites.  I am currently assisting in the excavation of a site in Jamestown dated to 1611; this is a fantastic project to be a part of.  We have been excavating the site all Spring and Summer in 10′ x 10′ squares and are slowly uncovering a great story here.  My job lately consists of recovering and documenting artifacts, mapping soil plans and profiles, and a lot of hand-troweling at the subsoil level to look for features or stains in the clay.  I’m very happy and proud to take part in documenting America’s beginnings and hope to continue my work in the area for some time!

"80","Was Michael Faraday (1791-1867), the greatest scientist of his age, also a pioneering archaeological scientist?  New evidence suggests that he was, even if his contribution has long since been forgotten.  Michael Faraday in the 1830s (from Wikimedia Commons)Over the past few days I’ve been trying to piece together some clues to a (minor) historical mystery: was the famous and brilliant nineteenth-century scientist Michael Faraday one of the first people to use scientific methods to analyse archaeological materials?  If so, this raises some interesting questions, and may contradict some of what we think we know about early ‘antiquarian’ archaeology.Most of my work on the history of archaeology has focused on the histories of public archaeology and of Egyptian mummy studies.  A few weeks ago in the footnotes to Thomas Pettigrew’s History of Egyptian Mummies published in 1834 I found a reference to “Dr. Faraday, the highly-talented professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution” and a note from Faraday describing his study of some crystals found inside a mummy:“The small needle-like crystals are very curious … It burns with a bright flame, and evidently abounds in carbon and hydrogen.  It is not soluble in water, and has the odour, when heated, of a fatty matter; but then alkali acts very feebly upon it … The substance may probably be a result of slow action upon organic (perchance animal) matter”Faraday and the Egyptian mummy scholar Pettigrew had known each other since childhood, and their collaboration might just have been Faraday doing a favour for an old friend.  Still it intrigued me.  I checked, and none of the huge pile of Faraday biographies published over the years mention him having an interest in archaeology.I consulted with Faraday expert Professor Frank James, who pointed me to a set of letters that Faraday had exchanged in the early 1830s with John Gage of Hengrave Hall, an antiquarian who worked mostly on the history of Suffolk, as well as conducting excavations of mounds and monuments.Gage published several article in the Society of Antiquaries journal Archaeologia in the 1830s, including several reports of excavations in Essex and Suffolk.  Having hunted these articles down, for the past few days I’ve been reading through them to try and understand Faraday’s contributions.  Gage describes excavating monuments including a Roman tomb, and sending the finds off to be analysed.  He sent the bones to William Clift, conservator at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, and the rest he sent to Faraday.Faraday’s report is included in one of the Archaeologia articles.  It contains  descriptions of the artefacts including glass bottles, a coin, and some fatty and resinous lumps.  His report says that he boiled, burned, distilled, sniffed, crystallised, dissolved and weighed them: as comprehensive a set of analyses as mid-nineteenth century science could offer.  Not quite what modern archaeological scientists get up to (I gather), but not too far off either.  Enough to say that Michael Faraday can definitely be called an archaeological scientist – and a very early one at that.The history of archaeology, we are taught, is one of emerging from darkness towards enlightenment: amateurish antiquarians gave way to stratigraphers and scientists, and today we’re all enlightened post-post-processualists.  Or something. Of course nothing’s that simple – we all stand on the shoulders of giants, even if it’s more fashionable to give those who came before us a good kicking.The fact that Michael Faraday (and others such as Clift) provided specialist reports for archaeological publications in the 1830s doesn’t necessarily mean that he sparked the development of modern archaeological science: in fact his contribution appears to have been forgotten.  But it’s reminded me that the history of archaeology contains all sorts of curiosities and oddities that make it fun and worthwhile.Gabe Moshenska, UCL Institute of Archaeology.g.moshenska@ucl.ac.ukThe Michael Faraday: Archaeological Scientist? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"81","Working as an archaeologist within a local authority may not always be the full Indiana Jones experience but taking today as a ‘typical’ day it can certainly be varied. I work within the Historic Environment Service at Norfolk County Council as the ‘Assistant Historic Environment Officer (Countryside)’. In a rural county like Norfolk the countryside is obviously highly significant but what does this really mean for us?In my case it mostly means undertaking historic environment consultations for ‘Farm Environment Plans’ as part of the Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) scheme. This is an agri-environment scheme delivered by Natural England that provides funding to farmers and other land managers in England to deliver effective environmental management on their land.We are consulted on every HLS application in the county to assess the potential opportunities to manage the historic environment as part of the scheme. We identify what historic environment features are present within each holding and which are worthy of management, we then use a series of standard recommendations and additional feedback to advise on the best way to manage sites. For example we might suggest that a Roman villa which is currently under the plough would benefit from removal from cultivation to prevent damage or we may have earthworks like a Bronze Age burial mound which we want to see cleared of scrub and managed in grassland. Natural England can then make informed decisions on how best to proceed. This process alone gives me a huge amount of variety and allows me to have a fantastic overview of so much of the county and the amazing historic environment sites it possesses. My colleague, the Historic Environment Officer (Countryside) also deals very much with helping landowners manage sites on their land through the very successful Norfolk Monuments Management Project which I’ll let him talk about!So today I have started work on a consultation for an HLS FEP but I have also carried out a number of other entirely different tasks. For example, I work within the Heritage Asset Management Team here at the HES which also deals with planning applications and archaeological work associated with development. I take on a number of planning cases each week and specifically deal with works in churches and churchyards so I have responded to a number of planning queries this afternoon including those regarding drainage in churchyards and works in redundant churches.I also have a post graduate specialism in maritime archaeology and have had the opportunity to use this today by accompanying a colleague on a site visit with maritime implications in an advisory capacity.So you see – never a dull moment!The Variety – The spice of life? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The aerial photograph below looks towards the park, just beyond the tenements, now taken up by the caravan park, playing fields and a sports stadium.A-listed Craigie House was built c1730 for Sir Thomas Wallace, and sold in 1783 to William Campbell, who had made a fortune in India.

"83","Hello! Kayt here, and this year I am finally in the field for the Day of Archaeology! I’m working with my colleagues Gijs and Tymon (who isn’t here because his third child is arriving any day now!) from the Minor Centers project at the University of Groningen in the Pontine Plain. The project is looking specifically at the role of minor central places in the economy of Roman Central Italy. You can read a lot more about the background of the project and access our fieldwork reports and papers on the project website.We’re in Italy for a few weeks to do two things. First of all, Gijs is here with a team of student volunteers drawing and cataloging finds from fieldwalking surveys last Autumn and early this year. There is an awful lot of ceramic material associated with the sites we’re examining as part of the project, so they have a huge task! Yesterday they passed the 1,000th sherd drawn, and they still have crates and crates to process! It’s vital work though: we need a good understanding of the ceramics in order to date the sites we find, and if possible, understand their function. Sometimes we can locate sherds with a very specific purpose, like milk strainers used in cheese production. At other times we can identify production sites because we find by-products of industrial processes like iron slag or over-fired pottery that has a particular glassy surface. With a thorough understanding of the ceramic material, we can date our sites and say something about their function. If we can go one step further and identify pottery production sites and trace the clays and temper used in the pots, we can start to examine short-distance trade networks. We have a specialist joining the project in the Autumn to do just this! With all of these elements in place, we can build up a network of minor towns and road-stations trading with each other and over greater distances, and with the chronological data from the ceramics, we can examine how that network changed over time, perhaps in response to policies handed down from Rome.Drawing progress at basecampI arrived two days ago with a team of topographical survey specialists from our institute to carry out a series of geophysical surveys on targets identified by the fieldwalking. The aim of our geophysical surveys is to understand the spatial limits and layout of the sites we find by fieldwalking, or that are already known from historical records and previous archaeological work. The reason we are braving almost 40 degree temperatures to do this, is because one of our key sites, Astura, lies within a major military base. We can only have access for survey in July and August, when the military (quite rightly) think it is too hot to work and go on shut-down. So we’ve been there today and yesterday. It’s painstaking work because the area is covered in dense forest. We have identified a series of open clearings that are probably in the area of the archaeological site and we are slowly surveying them with single-sensor handheld gradiometers. We can’t use the very fast cart-based systems with multiple sensors, in part because of all the trees and bushes, and because the more modern systems rely on dGPS: we have tree cover. This means we need to work on grids recorded in a total station and tied in to the ‘real world’ using reference points on things like buildings. This is why we have the specialist topographers with us! Sander and Erwin make my life a lot more simple. I only have to worry about the geophysics, and they take care of the rest, which is great. We did some work in the same area last year and identified two possible kilns or perhaps salt-production hearths and possible traces of walls. But the data from the last two days is disappointing: either we are outside the settlement area, or the buildings are too deeply buried or poorly contrasted for us to discover. We’ll have a discussion tonight about whether it is good to return tomorrow to finish the area free of trees, or whether we should move on to one of the inland sites near the via Appia. The picture below is one of the most open areas of the site, right by the sea. You can just about see the Torre Astura in the background, between the pine trees. The building you can see now is medieval but it occupies an area in use since well before the Roman period.Magnetometers warming up this morning, with Torre Astura in the backgroundIt is very hot and dusty work, and I am very grateful to my student volunteer Tom, who is giving up a chunk of his summer to help out. I wouldn’t change my job for all the tea in china though. Italy is an amazing country, with wonderful people and beautiful places to be outdoors working at. Today alone I’ve seen three different kinds of lizards and a wild boar and her stripey piglets running across the road to the site. Who knows what we’ll see tomorrow? Or find in the data? Perhaps a nice early christian church, or a roman cemetery? Maybe I’ll find the kilns Gijs really wants to go with his pottery! However, tonight we have a big festa in the town we are staying in to enjoy, because it is the feast of Santa Anna, who is locally venerated.

"84","On the Day of Archaeology, we archaeologists get together and blog about all the different ways we do archaeology. Take a moment and browse this awesome site and you’ll find blogs on digging, research, office work, and life after grad school. You’ll also read about Public Archaeology (of which Day of Archaeology is part), the reaching out to the public, and making archaeology accessible to the public.I am a HUGE fan of public archaeology, but I take a slightly different twist on it.I am a Debunker. I use real archaeology to debunk pseudoarchaeology.Four years ago I started a blog called ArchyFantasies, where I’ve tackled everything from the infamous 10 Most Puzzling Ancient Artifacts to the current project of deciding who discovered America first. I also discuss archaeological history looking at it from the founding mother’s perspectives and I try to answer questions people send me about the weird, wacky world of archaeology.Four years and going I’m pretty pleased with the blog, and I’m even more pleased with how it’s grown. For the last three years now I have given presentations on debunking pseudoarchaeology at Gen Con, Incon, and The Center for Inquiry in Indianapolis. Hey I’m a gaming geek, and my goal is to reach out to everyday people. I also work with children doing mock-digs and teaching them about context and the archaeological process. I love reaching out to people and I’m really glad my little blog has led to me being able to do more.Still, debunking pseudoarchaeology is incredibly important, as is understanding why pseudoarchaeology is so popular and persists in modern time.Was Mound A built by some vanished and forgotten civilization, or by basket load by early Natives?Pseudoarchaeology makes the past fun, mysterious, and special. Through the manipulation of facts and evidence, sometimes resorting to simply making them up, Pseudoarchaeology tells us that Aliens visited the planet thousands of years ago, humans and dinosaurs lived together in harmony, and a now vanished race of people known as Atlantean pretty much created all culture and all of technology. It can validate cultural, racial, and national identities, like Afrocentrism or the Bosnian Pyramids. It can bolster religious validity like with Creationism. It can allow for thinly veiled racism like the total disregard of local native peoples with the Mysterious Mound Builders or insisting Aliens did everything for “primitive” ancient peoples. It can make the individual person special too because they now become the only ones to know the Truth, and “mainstream” archaeologists are part of a worldwide conspiracy to hide the Truth.Compare this to the real world of archaeology. The real, sweaty, labor intensive, research heavy, jargon laden, paper writing world of archaeology. Half the time when you start telling the average person how you’re comparing the ground-truthing of a magnetometer reading with the traditional interpretation of said magnetometer reading you can watch their eyes cross as they try to stay politely interested. The other half of the time they want to know if you’ve found gold or dinosaurs.It’s not a spaceship, it’s a magnetometer.The public loves archaeology; we see evidence of this with the success and endurance of every Indiana Jones movie (whether or not they were good), the success of TV shows like Time Team and Ancient Aliens (now in its 5th season) and the popularity of magazines like Archaeology and Popular Archaeology. The problem isn’t the public’s lack of interest; it’s the public’s inability to get a hold of good information.An aspect of real archaeology, digging deep, by hand.With shows like Diggers, American Diggers, Ancient Aliens, other random shows about the lost secrets of Atlantis and thousands of books/websites/podcasts discussing Viking Mound Builders in America, Alien skulls, Giant Burials, the fifth discovery of Noah’s Arch, Aliens building the Pyramids, Bigfoot, and my personal favorite, how all of us “mainstream” archaeologists are trying to keep the TRUTH from the public, it’s hard for the public to figure out what’s what. Especially when academic archaeology is basically silent, particularly on these topics.Another tick infested aspect of archaeology. Survey in the woods.In the March 2013 issue of the SAA’s Archaeological Record, David S. Anderson, Jeb J. Card, and Kenneth L. Feder made a plea to the archaeological community to band together to reclaim the public perception of Archaeology and to understand why pseudoarchaeology persists. Anderson et. al. thinks this attempt in understanding should be part of our jobs as professional archaeologists (2013:26). They see ignoring pseudoarchaeology as dismissing an important element of human culture (2013:26). They tell us we can’t ignore the modern popular relationship with the material past simply because it’s annoying (2013:27).Working with the public can be rewarding and get things done.I agree whole-heartedly.We as archaeologist need to address pseudoarchaeology when we see/hear it. We need more blogs like mine and Bad Archaeology. We need some skeptical Podcasts that address pseudoarchaeology and cover the actual archaeology behind those stories. We need more shows akin to Time Team that can directly compete with shows like Diggers et al. If we can’t do that, we need to address pseudoarchaeology in the class room, in the local newspapers, and even in the public sphere.Four years ago I started a simple blog on addressing pseudoarchaeology, I did it in my spare time, and it’s blossomed into a whole lot more. I challenge everyone posting on the Day of Archaeology blog to dedicate one post on their own blogs/websites on the topic. I’ll even offer to host the post on my own blog! Let’s do it, let’s band together and give the public what they really want, solid facts about real archaeology. The Sometimes You Just Have to Debunk It. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"85","Pompeian books. OK there are some less ‘academic’ titles in there too.Photo S HayI am a field archaeologist (I write this to remind myself more than anyone) and although I find myself sitting at a desk buried under a mass of books, off-prints and scribbled notes (I am very much in the paper archaeology camp when it comes to research) it is only because I spent four years collecting data in the field that I now find myself inside, writing it up as a PhD.Oh, and that “field” happened to be Pompeii.PompeiiPhoto S HayThe site has always resonated with people and no more so than now as the exhibition at the British Museum in London on ‘The Life and Death of Pompeii and Herculaneum’ (to rightly give it it’s full title and not squeeze it down to ‘The Pompeii Exhibition’) has caused a massive resurgence of interest in the Vesuvian cities.UK television has been awash with programmes detailing the fate of both cities, but in particular, Pompeii. It was nothing short of miraculous that in one documentary you didn’t see the filming of another in the background, so crowded did the site become with Pompeian pundits. Suddenly, experts or not, people had something to say and everyone was listening. It’s a fortuitous time to be studying Pompeii.I can smugly say I have not jumped on the most recent Pompeian bandwagon. I just jumped on one that was passing in 1997 when I was employed by Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, the then director of The British School at Rome, to come and work on his Pompeii Project.Just looking at a wall – wasn’t trusted with context sheets in the early days! The project studied the life of an insula – a block of 9 Roman houses half way between the forum and the amphitheatre on the via dell’ Abbondanza. It’s not a particularly pretty block of houses and certainly was not filled with the wealthiest of proprietors but this was the point. The project aimed to explore the non-elite life of Romans in Pompeii. The archaeology of this level of Roman society was much understudied at the outset of our project with the majority of research concentrating on the major public monuments and luxurious private houses and villas. We were looking at the common people. Integrated into the project was a study of all recorded finds from the excavations in the 1950s carried out by Dr. Joanne Berry.One of my study houses during excavations in the 1950sPhoto courtesy of Soprintendenza di PompeiiMy research involved the design and implementation of a system to record standing buildings. This then forms the basis for the chronological analysis of a block of houses with a view to understanding the phases of development of a group of houses through time. Each wall (and they have 2 sides lest you forget) and floor surface was analysed stratigraphically using contexts, all 2585 of them, as you would in stratigraphic excavation. By putting walls and floors together to make rooms, and rooms together to make houses you can complete the jigsaw of the insula to reveal its current form but along the way, witness the changes in property divisions, the redesigning of internal spaces, and even the small repairs to cracks in the walls.This may sound cold and remote but once you get to the desk stage, you get to see the small neighbourhood as a whole; like peeking into a large living dolls house. You get to see the transformations that the community underwent, the wrangles with neighbours over the heights of adjoining walls, the expansion of the successful drinking establishment, the vulgar scribbled words of a graffito by a cheeky neighbour, the mundane chore of an individual who perhaps grudgingly fixed the leaky pipe, and the general Smith’s keeping up with the Jones’ in terms of decorative fashions. It’s not just looking at walls, bricks and mortar (but I did do that. A lot. And when I say a lot, I mean it) but its about getting to grips with the inhabitants and the people who built the walls in the first place. And second. Well, and third and fourth places if wishing to do any justice at all to my phase plans. Not paperless ArchaeologyPhoto S HaySo, I find myself, 16 years later, on Day of Archaeology buried under a pile of literary Pompeian pumice. The field work is complete and I just have to write it up. Simple enough, right? The wealth of Pompeian published texts is overwhelming. The sheer quantity of field notes and scribbled out annotations on plans I have accumulated from years of fieldwork is daunting. And somehow, I am expected to order, make sense of and process all of these things, whilst remaining coherent and retain a clear argument and rationale for my work. Not easy in 33 degrees of heat in Italy. But it’s a fun challenge. And besides, part of me simply believes I am participating in an ancient Roman neighbourhood watch scheme; checking in on each of the houses and their owners to keep tabs on what they are up to. Its just a scheme that happens to last for over 300 years.The Buried under a pile of literary pumice.

"86","My name is Claire Bradshaw and I am a Community Archaeologist at Norfolk Historic Environment Service, which is part of Norfolk County Council.  The Historic Environment Service exists to record, protect and manage the archaeology of Norfolk, and my job is to get members of the public involved in this process.I have been in the post for just over a month, having worked here on a Council for British Archaeology training placement since October. June and July are the busiest months for community archaeology in Norfolk so things have been very hectic since I started.My work so far has involved planning community test pitting projects; giving talks to local groups and schools; promoting our services at the Norfolk Show; supervising work experience students and organising an Archaeology Day at Gressenhall Farm and Workhouse, as part of the Festival of Archaeology.Yesterday morning I gave a talk to the Sheringham and District Society at their monthly meeting, on the archaeology of the North Norfolk coast. I was quite nervous about this as the talk was arranged by my predecessor, who managed the Norfolk Coastal Heritage project, and co-authored a book about Happisburgh!Fortunately for me Norfolk’s coast has some excellent archaeology, from the earliest evidence of human occupation in northern Europe at Happisburgh right the way through to the World War II anti-tank cubes in Sheringham, and even better, all of these sites are recorded in the Historic Environment Record, which contains information on over 60000 archaeological and historic sites from around Norfolk. This record can be accessed online at www.heritage.norfolk.gov.ukI was also greatly helped by the work my colleagues have been doing since 2001 on the National Mapping Programme. This is an English Heritage project to identify and map archaeological features using aerial photographs. The report on The Archaeology of Norfolk’s Coastal Zone (which you can read here: http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/archaeology-norfolks-coastal-zone-nmp/ ) enabled me to easily identify some of the more interesting archaeology in the area, and which of our 85000 aerial photographs would be most useful in my talk. My favourite is one taken of Warham Camp (NHER 1828) by Derek Edwards.After answering several interesting questions and agreeing to host the group at Gressenhall so they can visit our archives, I popped over to Binham to support the local history group in their second day of investigations at the village hall.The Roman Binham project has been running for four years, during which time they have excavated in nearly every garden in the village. Their main aim is to find evidence of the possible Roman villa which is said to be under the village hall, and although they have found large quantities of Roman pottery, and part of a wall, we have not yet managed to find conclusive evidence.This year’s project was part of the Festival of British Archaeology, and as well as all of the enthusiastic local diggers, we had excavators coming to join us from as far away as France!In true Time Team fashion the find of the project came at 3.15 yesterday afternoon, when Alan straightened up his section only to find a large beautifully decorated rim sherd which had been hidden by lumps of flint.To find out more about Binham Local History Group and find out where the project will be heading next take a look at their website http://www.binhampriory.org/BLHG.htmlAfter all the hard work yesterday, I spent today tidying up my inbox (and desk!) preparing to go on holiday next week.Look out for posts from my colleagues to find out what the rest of our service does.The Community Archaeology in Norfolk by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I have been in post for almost  5 years.We started a brand new HLF project in February, its called ’Exploring Tinsley Manor’. We are working with Wessex Archaeology and Tinsley Junior School to find out about the lost medieval Tinsley Manor House which is buried underneath the school field. We have been working with Year 5 children weekley looking at all aspects of local history (including dressing up, looking at objects writing poems, going for walks, growing crop marks, making maps….you get the idea)Its a really interesting school  in an interesting and very historic part of Sheffield which is now a bit squashed between Meadowhall shopping centre and the M1. The majority of the children speak English as a second language, its a really loveley positive environement to work in. Even though we are mostly working with Y5 the whole school have been involved. In May all the children helped to do a resistivity survey of the field.Then for 2 weeks at the end of June we excavated, we had 4 small trenches lots of amazing volunteers and 15 different children every half an hour for 2 weeks. It was wonderful! I think i might have enjoyed it more than the children.  We found lots of things (including a very small flint and some medieval pottery) We had visitors from the local heritage group, the local MP, a lovely local press artical. All good stuff.This week i have been recoverning, tidying up and trying very hard to catch up with everything i have been neglecting in favor of Tinsley. Except for Tuesday when i went to Stavely Hall with a group of adults who i taught last year as part of the WEA’s Digability project.And Wednesday when we had the wonderful Heeley Heritage Volunteers in, finds processing ceramicsToday mostly I sat here and drank tea.I spent quite a lot of time replying to e-mails, sorting and tidying. I  also enjoyed trying to find out a bit about this mystery object.A lovely chap brought it in on monday hoping i would be able to tell him more about it, we think its a cannon ball he has lots of contxtual information which is great. Its one of the nice bits of my job that people quite often bring me interesting things, if anyone has any suggestions about this one i would be glad. I know nothing about cannon balls….yet.The rest of the day have quite a bit of chatting in it, and some breaks to do a bit of office decorating and unscruffing. And then I sorted out part of what we are going to be doing for this years Heritage Open Days in September.Looking forward to the weekend. The Friday is for recovering by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"88","The archaeology of Sumburgh, Shetland.The author in Levenwick c.1977. Copyright Mike MiddletonI’m Mike Middleton and I manage two nationwide archaeological mapping projects. The Historic Land-Use Assessment , is mapping signs of past land-use preserved within the modern landscape and the Canmore Mapping is focussing on the known extent of archaeological sites recorded in the RCAHMS Canmore online record of monuments.I’ve chosen the archaeology of Sumburgh at the south end of mainland Shetland where I spent many happy hours, as a child, scrambling over the archaeological sites without really knowing what they were. Both my parents worked at the airport and being busy people, they were often at work when I finished school. So I would spend time out playing with my friends, on the beaches and land around the airport. There were loads of great places to play. One of our favourites was the abandoned WWII defences. Built quickly out of poured concrete onto sand, the buildings had no foundations and have subsided and partially collapsed over the years providing the perfect place for young boys to play war games.If we were feeling more adventurous we would head down to watch the seals and sea birds at the bottom end of the Ness of Burgi. En route we would pass the Ness of Burgi fort. Known as a blockhouse or gatehouse fort and built during the Iron Age, around 100BC, the fort has a rectangular gatehouse cutting off a narrow promontory. With its low, broch-like entrance and cells to each side it was an excellent playhouse.The Ness of Burgi blockhouse from the north-west. Copyright RCAHMS (SC 342869].A view from inside the reconstructed wheelhouse at Scatness. Public contribution to Canmore, Copyright Mike MiddletonMost amazing to me now, as I had no idea it was there at the time, is the multi phase site of Scatness. The site was excavated in the late 1990s and revealed evidence for Iron Age, Norse and Post-Medieval settlement. It is dominated by the remains of a broch and surrounding wheelhouses. Both of these monument types are Iron Age drystone structures specific to Scotland. Brochs are hollow-walled and tower-like in form while wheelhouses incorporate a series of stone piers within the outer wall much like the spokes on the wheel of a bike. I still find it hard to believe that so much was under the ground I played on and invisible to me at the time. Equally amazing is the proximity of the Scatness site to the very similar and just as complex multi phase site of Jarlshof.An image of a Viking ship incised into a piece of slate. The author’s favourite find from Jarlshof. Copyright RCAHMS (SC1221187)Although as children we didn’t know Scatness was there, we weren’t short of brochs to play on because just opposite the end of one of the runways is Brough Head broch or Eastshore broch as I knew it as a kid. The site is partially eroded by the sea, cutting it in half, something of particular fascination to us children. Like Scatness and Jarlshof the broch is surrounded by unexcavated earth covered structures and abandoned 19th-century farm buildings. It is quite possible that if excavated this site could be as complex as Scatness and Jarlshof.Brough Head broch from the sea showing the two walls of the broch exposed. Public contribution to Canmore, Copyright Mike MiddletonSumburgh has an incredibly rich archaeological resource. I look back with fondness and frustration at my youth playing on these monuments. I feel lucky that I have had the chance to grow up in such a rich archaeological environment while disappointed I didn’t understand what they were at the time. However, the sites of Sumburgh also provide a snapshot of the big issues facing our heritage today. The hastily built WWII defences were constructed as temporary structures. Made from concrete and often in poor repair many of us don’t realise their historical significance. These factors mean that our wartime sites are one of the most rapidly diminishing archaeological resources in Scotland. The Brough Head broch, Jarlshof and the Ness of Burgi Fort are all suffering the effects of coastal erosion, a threat facing thousands of sites worldwide and those maintaining the sites at Scatness and Jarlshof, have to balance the needs of conservation with the thousands of tourists who wish to visit these wonderful sites. What the archaeology of Sumburgh illustrates is it that not every site can be saved. It is just a matter of time before sites like Brough Head are lost to the sea and there just isn’t the resource to save all the threatened sites in Scotland. However, we can record these monuments and make this information available so we, or others in the future, can try and understand them better. We can’t all excavate sites but we can all take a photograph and draw a plan. We don’t need to excavate every site to understand it. By taking photographs or drawing plans we can all record vital information. You can be part of this process by visiting sites, helping to record them and then uploading your research using the MyCanmore public contribution tool. We need your help to record our heritage. We can only do it together!This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.The Mike Middleton (RCAHMS) – Shetland by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"90","Hello. I’m Rob Hedge, and I’m a CBA Community Archaeology Bursary holder at the Worcestershire Archive & Archaeology Service. The service is based at The Hive, Worcester – a new (and very shiny!) facility that also houses the integrated city and University of Worcester libraries. Being in such a prominent building has meant a big increase in visitors to our public office, where people can drop in and find out about the information we hold on the archaeology of their area in our Historic Environment Record (HER).The Hive, Worcester Besides the staff who maintain and update the HER and carry out ‘searches’ for the public, the Service includes archaeologists who advise developers and local authorities on issues such as planning and countryside management. Our Field Section, Worcestershire Archaeology, are a commercial unit who carry out developer-funded archaeological work. All of this means that we are one of the largest local authority archaeology organisations in the UK, and that my role in helping to plan and run outreach projects is busy and varied!Today, I’ve been sorting through the records and photographs from our #DigBromsgrove community excavation. The dig was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund as part of a scheme to regenerate Bromsgrove town centre by unlocking the hidden heritage of the town. Throughout the course of the dig we had around 40 volunteers involved in the site work, doing everything from setting out the site grid and drawing scale plans to finds processing, filling out the context records and putting together the site ‘matrix’. We believe that it’s really important that participants in community archaeology projects don’t just ‘dig’, and that they learn about all the other skills that are crucial to being able to carry out an excavation. Many of our volunteers are members of local societies, and the skills they learn with us with benefit those groups when they undertake their own fieldwork.Teaching Volunteers, DigBromsgrove In addition to the volunteers, we had around 500 schoolchildren coming to visit the site, for whom we constructed an archaeological sand-box complete with features and genuine archaeological artefacts for them to uncover.Constructing an archaeological sandpit We backfilled the trench and dismantled the sand-box on Monday, and are now beginning the post-excavation process. All the finds from the site are currently being cleaned, catalogued and labelled, and will then be analysed by our specialists.The DigBromsgrove finds, awaiting processing I’ve also spent part of the day planning for an event taking place next week at the brilliant Infirmary Museum in Worcester. During a watching brief on building works as the old Worcester Royal Infirmary became the University of Worcester’s new City Campus, archaeologists from our service came across a peculiar deposit: a jumbled assortment of over 1800 fragments of human bone, with various grisly features from saw marks to embedded iron pegs, as well as a whole range of painful-looking pathologies! Were these the victims of some maniacal serial killer?Femur showing lytic lesion caused by cyst, and saw ‘kerf’ In fact, Ossafreelance‘s brilliant analysis revealed a much more intriguing source – the bones turned out to be medical waste from 18th and 19th century, including items from amputations, dissections and teaching collections – some still with traces of the fixings that would have held the skeletons together! This gory assemblage is the largest discovered within a post-medieval provincial infirmary, and is a fascinating insight into historic surgical practices.So, I’ve spent a lot of time today looking through some pretty grisly pictures, and feeling rather lucky to live in the 21st century.If you’re around in Worcester on Wednesday 31st, come along to Infirmary Unearthed and find out more!If you’d like to find out more about what I’m up to, I’m on Twitter: @robhedge.

"91","Imogen Gunn, Collections Manager for Archaeology, MAA writes: This past week at the Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology (MAA), Cambridge, has been proved to be an excellent example of why I love working in museum archaeology – convenient that it should so happily overlap with the Day of Archaeology!As the Collections Manager for Archaeology, no two days are ever the same and this is one of the (many) joys of the job. One day I will be getting collections out for a researcher visiting from overseas, another day I’m tracking down a letter in the archive relating to a specific artefact in our collection, and often I find myself re-packing boxes and cursing whoever used cotton wool to pack ironwork. Another aspect of my post is facilitating education and engagement using MAA’s reserve archaeology collection, whether it be teaching Cambridge undergraduate practicals or hosting hands-on sessions with local community groups.This week, the archaeology workroom at MAA hosted the Sutton Trust Summer School for Archaeology and Biological Anthropology. The aim of the Sutton Trust Summer Schools is to give bright students from non-privileged backgrounds a university experience, with the aim of demystifying elite universities and encourage them to apply. On Tuesday, ten extremely bright Year 12 students from all around the UK arrived at MAA to experience what it would be like to read archaeology and biological anthropology at the University of Cambridge.Imogen leading an object handling session for the Summer SchoolOver the course of the week, the students attended such lectures as Bodies of Evidence: How Human Skeletal Remains Help Us Explore the Past, Science & Archaeology and Material Culture: Secret Agents of the Past. After attending a Handling Museum Objects practical, each student chose an artefact for his or her Object Report. In between lectures, they spent time in the archaeology workroom studying, measuring and bonding with their artefact and in the Haddon Library researching it.This morning the summer school culminated with the students presenting their artefact (to which most had grown quite attached) and their reports to the group. Each student tackled the assignment slightly differently: some focused on how the object was produced and used, others elaborated on the religious context or symbolic importance, and one student managed to date her artefact based on manufacturing technique. I certainly learned a great deal!The Sutton Trust Summer School studentsI enjoy (almost) all facets of my job, but this week was particularly rewarding.

A map with all the sites included to date can be found here. It’s still very much a work in progress!Archaeology is rarely glamorous (too much mud and dust) but somehow, today, I’ve assigned myself the most unglamorous task of all: I’ve spent my time trawling through a stratigraphic index (that’s the list of different contexts that were excavated at a site), identifying the early medieval samples, and then adding them to my database. It’s tedious and time-consuming, but absolutely necessary for multi-phase sites, to ensure that my dataset isn’t biased by the inclusion of material from a different period, either earlier or later.The good news is that, now that this is done, I’m ready to start real analysis of the results on Monday. Meanwhile, I’m off to enjoy a database-free weekend!The Looking at crops and weeds from early medieval Galway, Ireland by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"93","Leanne McCafferty, RCAHMSRenfrewshire ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’After graduated with an archaeology degree in 2002, I began working at RCAHMS on a partnership project with our Welsh counterparts, RCAHMW. This involved looking at how the two organisations recorded information about the built heritage including archaeology, architecture and marine sites. I  am currently a project manager within the Data and Recording section with a particular interest in the history of recording at RCAHMS and how this is reflected in the information we make available through our Canmore database. In an attempt to illustrate this, I’ve chosen the site of St Fillan’s Well.The holy well of St Fillan lies to the east of Kilallan, a farm near Kilmacolm in Refrewshire. It is one of 276 holy wells recorded in the Canmore database.These wells were associated with early medieval saints (although their use could have been much more ancient than this) and were reputed to have healing waters. The holy wells recorded in the Canmore database claim to cure a variety of maladies from deafness to “nervous diseases”. In the case of St Fillan, reputedly an Irish monk, the waters of his well have folk traditions associating it with the curing of rickets in children. Nearby the well are two associated monuments, St Fillan’s Seat and St Fillan’s Church, which is dedicated to the saint.An engraving of St Anthony’s Well from William Ballingall’s Edinburgh Past and Present. Copyright RCAHMS (SC431735)The information RCAHMS holds on the well is taken from the Ordnance Survey Archaeology Division’s record card. The cards were transferred to RCAHMS in 1983 and provided the foundation for what would become the database we use to record monuments today. This information is then available to the public through Canmore. The record cards provided a brief description of the site along with references to relevant publications and a map. They were compiled by the Archaeology Division office-based recorders and then passed to the field staff, who in turn would investigate the monument. The office recorders would assemble the monument descriptions from existing publications such as the RCAHMS County Inventories and Statistical Accounts.Ordnance Survey record card for St Fillan’s Well. Copyright RCAHMSFor St Fillan’s Well, multiple sources have been consulted to construct a concise history and description of the site. The well was first recorded in the Old Statistical Accounts in 1791. The statistical accounts were first collected in the 18th century by Church of Scotland ministers and described the geography, agriculture and culture of their respective parishes. The Reverend John Monteath was responsible for Houston parish in which St Fillan’s Well is located and describes how the well was used for curing “rickety babies” until it was filled in by a local minister at the end of the 18th century. It also records the tradition of leaving cloth as a votive offering which means St Fillan’s was also a rag or ‘clootie’ well. One of the more famous clootie wells is located at Hill O’Hirdie near Munlochy in the Highlands.The well was mapped by the Ordnance Survey in 1856 and recorded in the Object Name Book. These books were used by the OS staff to record the place names that were used on maps. Ordered by parish, a copy of the Name Books is available for public consultation on microfiche in the RCAHMS Search Room.First Edition OS map (Renfrewshire 1863, sheet VII) depicting St Fillan’s Well. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’In 1895 a paper exploring the association of the cult of St Fillan with Kilallan was published by J M Mackinlay in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. More recent publications on the well include Scottish Healing Wells (F and R Morris 1982) and W H Lyle’s The History of Bridge of Weir (1975).Renfrewshire was not included in the county inventory survey by RCAHMS, but when it was visited by the Ordnance Survey in 1955, it was reported the field investigator that the well was being used as a cattle trough.To see the Canmore record for St Fillan’s Well, see http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/42246/details/kilallan+st+fillan+s+well/This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Leanne McCafferty (RCAHMS) – Renfrewshire by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"94","My name is Sandra and I am an archaeologist currently dedicated to my Phd Thesis. Today, July 26th, I’m writing. My office is in Barcelona, very close to the beach. In hot and humid days such as today, you can even smell the salty see in every corridor of the building. My aim for today is to write a big chunk of the chapter I’m working on these days, which is the spatial analysis of a site called “Artisans’ Quarters” in Mochlos, Crete (Bronze Age). And trying to scape the temptation to jump into the sea!By “spatial analysis” I mean something pretty simple: in a given settlement, I identify where people performed specific activities and then I see if people did mingle a lot or, on the contrary, their everyday lifes developed in segregated spaces. I am specially interested in the cooks, those people who had to cook everyday to ensure the survival of the group. So I’ve basically spent the last years trying to find kitchens, hearths, cooking pots, querns, faunal remains… to have a glimpse of their lifes. But, for my Phd thesis, I work with published materials, which means that my quest is basically in the libraries and work is done in front of a computer.This year is being specially hard because I must finish my thesis and cannot dedicate time to the fun part of the work: “the field”. Normally, every summer I participate in different excavation projects in Crete, where the office dissapears and you get “to touch soil”. Now I miss it. I miss my friends, I miss the landscape, I miss the work, and I miss Greece. Hopefully, next summer I will be able to resume my duties there, until then… writing, writing, writing.My archaeological dayThe Writing about the “cooks” by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"95","As the Planning Archaeologist for Norfolk County Council Historic Environment Service I work as part of a team providing heritage asset management advice to local planning authorities, developers, consultants and archaeological contractors. This can take the form of advice on the possible impact of proposed developments on the historic environment and the requirements for archaeological work to be carried out through the planning process both ahead of, and during, developments.Another aspect of my job involves monitoring the work being carried out by archaeological contractors in Norfolk – making sure that archaeological projects are carried out to the appropriate standards from the design stage, through the fieldwork and reporting, right through to the archiving and publication.This morning a colleague and I were out of the office at a site meeting to discuss a current excavation of an important archaeological discovery ‘somewhere in Norfolk’. The meeting involved the archaeological and construction contractors and representatives from the organisations funding the construction work. Discussions focussed on the significance of the discovery, the progress of the excavation and the requirements for post-excavation analysis and conservation of the archaeological remains.All very well, but you are probably wondering what these archaeological remains are and where in Norfolk they are being excavated? That unfortunately is where this part of my post has to fall silent for now and here’s why. It may seem strange on Day of Archaeology to talk of archaeological fieldwork needing to be carried out in relative secrecy but this is sometimes the case. During the process of excavation archaeological sites can be vulnerable to accidental damage by interested visitors, deliberate vandalism by disinterested visitors or the removal of artefacts – most likely through illegal metal detecting. Consequently it is sometimes necessary for details of archaeological discoveries to be kept quiet until after the fieldwork has been completed. In this particular case not only does the fragility of the archaeological remains place them at risk of damage but the archaeological work is taking place within an active construction site where unaccompanied public access would present a serious health and safety issue.It is likely that the current phase of archaeological fieldwork will be completed within the next week after which there will be a press release with full details of the archaeological remains. If you want to find out more about this exciting discovery keep an eye on our Twitter feed @NorfolkHES or Facebook page www.facebook.com/NorfolkHES and we will share the news item as soon as it’s available!James Albone, Planning Archaeologist, Norfolk County Council Historic Environment ServiceThe Heritage asset management – and why sometimes archaeology has to be a bit secret! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"96","Perth and Kinross. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’My name is Kirsty Millican and I work for the Historic Landuse Assessment (HLA) Project at RCAHMS. The site I would like to focus on may not seem the most spectacular; if you visited it today all you would see is an apparently unremarkable arable field. Instead, like many thousands of sites in Scotland, it is revealed to us just as cropmarks – the differential growth of crops above buried features -  photographed from the air. At Westerton in Perth and Kinross, these cropmarks reveal the former presence of a Neolithic timber enclosure (probably built sometime between around 3300 and 2600 BC, and classified on RCAHMS Canmore pages as a pit enclosure because of the way it is revealed on the aerial photograph), an enigmatic type of monument that I find as fascinating as much for the way in which it is revealed to us today as for the glimpse it gives us of the activities and structures built by our prehistoric ancestors.The image here shows the Westerton enclosure quite clearly – it’s the rectangular enclosure in the centre of the photograph defined by two parallel lines of five neat circular dark marks with one centrally placed mark at each end. These circular marks in the crop record the presence of buried post pits – the holes dug to take standing timber posts. The posts themselves have long since decayed and disappeared and only the infilled pits remain beneath the soil. And here’s my interpretation of these marks with the enclosure in red. North is at top of this image, so the enclosure is at a slightly different angle to that in the aerial photograph.Interpretation of the cropmarks at Westerton. The timber enclosure is in red, cropmarks of other features are in black. Copyright Kirsty MillicanToday there is nothing above ground to indicate that Westerton was once the location of an important prehistoric structure (see image below) and indeed it was built of a relatively ephemeral material, wood, which would decay and disappear over time. However, through the medium of differential crop growth and ripening caused by the buried features and the fact that those features were captured on a photograph taken from a small aeroplane, we have this picture of a monument constructed over 4000 years ago. Therefore, from these simple marks in the crop, it is possible to begin piecing together something of what people were doing, or at least building, here thousands of years ago. This in turn gives us a window onto the past peoples and societies, their lives, activities, beliefs and values. I continually find it amazing the something as apparently simple as the way in which crops grow can reveal so much.The location of the timber hall today within an apparently unremarkable arable field Copyright Kirsty MillicanSo let’s return to Westerton and see what it can tell us. The site at Westerton has never been excavated, but we know from similar sites dug elsewhere that it likely dates to the later Neolithic period (probably somewhere between around 3300 BC and 2600 BC) and that those post pits would have held substantial timber posts, probably of oak. This, then, was a substantial timber structure. For a variety of structural reasons it generally thought that Westerton, and other similar structures, are unlikely to have had a roof. Clues to the purpose and use of these timber enclosures are fragmentary, but they are usually interpreted as having some kind of ceremonial and/or funerary function. Below is one possible reconstruction of what Westerton may have looked like. As only the holes dug to take the upright timbers survive, inevitably there is a lot of speculation involved in reconstructions such as this. For example the timber posts may have been modified, carved or painted in some way, and there may well have been fencing between the posts. Despite what we do know, there remains an element of mystery about these Neolithic timber structures.  Nevertheless, images such as this at least help us to begin to imagine what they may have looked like.Speculative reconstruction of the timber enclosure at Westerton depicting the enclosure as formed by large, relatively unmodified timbers. Copyright Kirsty MillicanSome of the excavated sites that help us to interpret the cropmarks at Westerton are also found in Perth and Kinross, and the RCAHMS Canmore pages have some wonderful images of these sites. These include the timber structure excavated at Littleour and one at Carsie Mains. Another similar, though unexcavated, cropmark site has been recorded at Balrae. Several other timber enclosures are also known elsewhere in Scotland. Therefore, we know of several of these mysterious sites both in Perth and Kinross and beyond. Whether they were all exactly contemporary is impossible to say but, who knows, perhaps the same people who built Westerton knew of the structures at Littleour and Carsie Mains and the communities that built them. Certainly they knew the reasons for their construction, reasons that can only be vaguely grasped today, and will have participated in particular ceremonies and events both within and around these structures. Whatever they were used for, these were undoubtedly important structures. Think of the effort involved in cutting down oak trees without metal tools (these enclosures were built before the introduction of metal to Scotland, so stone axes must have been used) and of erecting the large timbers to form the enclosure without the use of modern machinery.There is much more that could be said about this site; there just isn’t enough room in a single blog post. However, I hope this has given some flavour of why I find sites such as Westerton so fascinating, and the way in which such ghostly marks in crops can reveal a wealth of information. This information would be unreachable (and indeed Westeron and many thousands of other cropmark sites would be entirely unknown) without a combination of the effects of buried archaeology on growing crops, the aerial survey of individuals and organisations such as RCAHMS and the luck that meant someone flew over this site at just the right moment to see and record it. The fact that all these factors came together at just the right time allows us to reach back to the things people and communities were doing and building in a location more than 4000 years ago. It truly is fascinating!This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.For further information you can also contact the local authority archaeologist.

"97","Eleanor Wilkinson, Collections Assistant for Archaeology, MAA writes:As the Collections Assistant for Archaeology at the Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology (MAA), Cambridge I am lucky enough to have my time split between projects so, for me, there is never a dull day in the archaeology workroom. Frustrating, intriguing, but never dull.Today is a ‘Matmar’ day. I am trying to create some semblance of order to a medium-sized collection of material excavated by the British Egyptologist Guy Brunton at Matmar in the 1920s and 30s. Many of the objects don’t appear to have been looked at or studied since they arrived in the 1930s. This has led to a number of issues such as poor documentation, loss of context, unknown locations and poor packing. The major issues of today, however, are trying to find enough room in our limited store to rehouse properly packed ceramics, and thinking through the processes needed to get the salt encrusted pottery back to looking like pottery and not fuzzy lumps. What happens when you innocently open a box – Matmar material in a very bad way. I have, very stupidly, opened a box. Not the best move I have made today as it holds some truly awful packing. How the 16 objects could fit in this box is a mystery. The sorting of these is especially daunting as most of the objects are not down on our Collections Database as being located in this box. In some cases they are not even listed as being in the museum. I have pulled out ceramics wrapped in newspaper from the 1970s, bubble wrap, corrugated brown paper, acid free tissue paper and cotton wool. As you can imagine, properly packed these objects will not all fit back into the same box. I am therefore attempting to rejig the store to try and create space for another large box. Along with this I am updating the Database with new locations, a simple but unbelievably time consuming task. I’m also making a note of previous locations before correcting them or creating new box lists so the history of the movement of objects can be tracked. The most satisfying part of this process – giving a ‘missing’ item a location. Win!On to the salt problem. Due to the type of clay used in some ceramics there is a tendency, under certain conditions, for the salt to leach out. We have the best conservator here at the MAA who I have dragged down from her conservation lab to take a look at what needs to be put through the process of desalination. Salt can be removed from fired ceramics by soaking them in a water bath of purified water, thereby dissolving the salt. Some of our ceramics from Matmar may only need a few days soaking, however there are some really bad examples. These take much longer as the water has to be replaced regularly. This brings me back to the packing problem. I now have to make sure there is enough room left in boxes for the ceramics up in conversation. Nightmare! Some of the MAA’s Matmar material has become very damaged by the leaching of salts. I often seem to come across boxes like this within the Egypt collections. I think to myself ‘I’ll just get this task done before I go to lunch’ and then peer inside a box and realise the next two days will be spent sorting out the calamity inside. But then next week I’ll see something new, and it is this diversity that makes me love what I do.I am writing a blog to accompany the project to repack and re-catalogue the Matmar material. It is called Store Stories and you can read about it here. Which reminds me, I need to start my blog post for that too this afternoon! The It’s only a box, what’s the worst that could happen? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"98","Like many archaeologists I wear more than one hat. I am a qualified aircraft engineer as well as a professional archaeologist – aviation and archaeology – strange bedfellows but very fulfilling!  This morning I was busy supporting engineering students at a local training college. This was interspersed with a rationalisation of some bags of finds from last weekend’s ‘Dig Devizes’. This was a community dig over two days. Running the children’s trench was a rewarding experience however; five year olds can produce very full finds trays! I’ve just weighed in and analysed a mass of CBM, not so informative unfortunately however there is also a substantial range of coins – everything from 1889 to 1991, clay pipe, a small silver bar and my favourite – ring-pulls. As part of my PhD I’ve been working with ring-pulls, a very important part of modern material culture (watch out for the paper!). Later today I will be writing up the context sheets for test pit DD 13 601 and forwarding them to the PM Jon Sanigar.  Now this afternoon I have been busy recording a recently discovered well  in my village. I run a community project, The Broad Town Archaeological Project (BTAP), encouraging locals to report and get involve in their local environment. Last Monday two guys taking down a fence discovered a cap-stone with a chalk blocked lined well below. This afternoon I will be recording this for our project and so we can submit the feature to the Wiltshire Building Record. After that I need to complete a watching brief report on some work I oversaw for the National Trust at the Sanctuary (Avebury). That was a nice day well spent. I work occasionally for a small archaeological contractor who specialises in small watching briefs in North Wiltshire – this allows me to build up a small pot of money to cover my fees for my part-time PhD at Exeter. Now depending on the time I get finished on reports I might well squeeze in a couple of hours on the thesis – I’m currently mapping cold war bunkers against a heterotopic/secret landscape/taskscape.So that’s my day – no spectacular digs or discoveries, more a community orientated effort. And that is archaeology for me – we often work in a position of authority but we should always remember the local community’s history we are digging. I have always enjoyed involving the local community; then I would do as one of the UKs foremost community archaeologists shaped my formative years – Professor Mick.

"99","Originally I wasn’t going to do an entry for Day of Archaeology this year as I was scheduled to be doing almost exactly the same thing I was doing last year, assessing waterlogged flots from waterfront dumps, which would have been a bit boring. However, following a visit from a project manager at 9 this morning, I am now tasked with identifying the species of wood used in a selection of Roman writing tablets before they get sent to a Roman cursive writing specialist for analysis. These tablets are just some of the over 300 recovered  from a large urban site in the centre of London, which you can read about at the Walbrook Discovery Blog.Before I start the writing tablets I assessed a couple of flots from the same site, as they were the last two in a box and I wanted to get it finished. They were very similar flots, full to bursting with bran, straw, moss, wood, some charcoal and waterlogged seeds. With those recorded I moved on to the writing tablets.In order to identify wood to species, you need to section it along three planes (transverse, radial and tangential), mount them on a slide and observe them with a high powered microscope. You can then look at the microscopic features that can be used to narrow down the list of possible features. As these are Roman artefacts, there’s a broader range of species that might have been used, as they tended to import a lot of stuff from the continent.Taking a wood sample of a Roman ruler for identificationGenerally speaking, writing tablets are made of silver fir, but at this site we’ve had a bit of variety so I was looking forward to a surprise. Unfortunately, there were no surprises to be had and all 16 have indeed turned out to be silver fir. However, Michael Marshall, one of our Roman finds specialists, saw I was doing wood ID’s and ran over to get a sneaky ID on an artefact he was recording – a Roman ruler. That turned out to be beech, so I got a bit of variety in my results today after all.The Karen Stewart (MOLA): Identifying Roman writing tablets by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Having just left Çatalhöyük on Wednesday after nearly three weeks in Anatolia, I’m very much playing catch up on research that has had to take a back seat since I’ve been away. I’ve spent much of the day feeling envious of the remaining Çatalhöyük faunal team who are all enjoying a trip to Göbekli Tepe today – I picked the worst time to leave!!Me staring a bone outMy day has been split between two research projects – one tedious (but worthy!) and the other more practical and interesting. I spent the morning doing some multivariate statistical analysis on a large dataset of around 25,000 animal bones. I’m using a snappily named approach called backwards stepwise binary logistic regression to assess what factors impact on the preservation and modification of animal bones in the archaeological record. This follows on from my PhD research and I’m currently looking in to the causes of abrasion of archaeological bones. Trampling, exposure to acidic conditions, utilisation, earthworm activity. bioturbation, boiling and roasting and water action have all been cited as causes of abraded (or polished) bone but until we know the factors that are important in its occurrence it’s difficult to make any sense of patterns.I spent the afternoon drilling, abrading, weighing and demineralising bone samples from the late Neolithic site of Durrington Walls, next to Stonehenge. I now have 50 chunks of pig jaw happily fizzing away in weak acid in the lab. This is the first part of the sample preparation for isotope analysis – in this instance I’ll be analysing the samples for carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotopes. Later I will also be testing the teeth from the jaws for strontium isotopes. This aim of the game is to understand more about how pigs were raised and where they came from. Durrington Walls is a huge feasting site and we know some cattle at the site came from Scotland thanks to the work of Sarah Viner and Jane Evans. It’s much more difficult to drag a pig over such distances, but I’m hoping I can get some evidence for long distance movement – pigs were of great importance to the feasts here and I think there’s a good chance they were sourced from a wide area. This will provide us with evidence of where people came from to take part in these great feasts.The A Day of Statistics, Isotopes and Drilling Bones by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

It is a satisfying and comforting ritual, one that I would whole-heartedly encourage other units (who don’t fear a little heart disease) to embrace.Mmm nachosAnd now back to my day-job as an archivist.

To this end, we hold bi-annual conferences with an emphasis on making East African and foreign scholars working in East Africa aware of each other’s research, as well as addressing issues affecting all researchers in East Africa such as policy regarding research requirements, collections management, and fieldwork ethics.  The second objective of the society is to raise funds for East African scholars to conduct field and laboratory research within East African countries. Let us introduce ourselves: the members of the EAAPP Secretariat are –1. Chairperson: Dr. Emma Mbua (Kenya), a Senior Research Scientist and the Head of Earth Sciences at the National Museums of Kenya, Kenya2. Vice Chairperson: Dr. Zeresenay Alemseged (Ethiopia), Chair of the Anthropology Department at the California Academy of Sciences, USA3. Organizing Secretary and Representative for the USA (USA): Dr. Briana Pobiner, Research Scientist and Museum Educator in the Human Origins Program, Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, USA4. Representative for Tanzania: Dr. Jackson Njau (Tanzania), Assistant Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences and Geoanthropology, Indiana University, USA5. Representative for Kenya: Dr. Purity Kiura (Kenya), Head of Archaeology at the National Museums of Kenya, Kenya6. Representative for Eritrea: Dr. Amanuel Beyin (Eritrea), Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice, University of Southern Indiana, USA7.

Representative for South America: Dr. Rene Bobe (Chile), Associate Professor, Department of Anthropology, George Washington University, USA Right now we’re in the throes of gearing up for our 4th bi-annual conference, which will begin in two days! It’s being held at the Leisure Lodge Resort in Mombasa, Kenya, from July 28th – August 2nd. The conference is organized by the secretariat of the EAAPP in coordination with the National Museums of Kenya (NMK). We’re very excited to have 52 presentations planned by researchers from all over the world. The archaeology talks range from discussions of the characterization and chronology of the earliest Acheulean at Konso, Ethiopia to characterization of obsidian sources and provenience of Middle Stone Age artifacts in the Kenyan Rift Valley, to the implications of ostrich eggshell strontium isotope analysis for reconstructing prehistoric exchange systems in the African Late Stone Age, to recent findings of multidimentional features of megalithic monument centers in southwestern Ethiopia. There are also papers on case studies of cultural heritage management such as conservation of the paleoanthropological record with limited resources: the case of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania and oil exploration in sensitive cultural landscapes: the case of Tullow Oil in the Lake Turkana Basin, Kenya. We invite you to visit our website: http://www.eaapp.or.ke/ and Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/East-African-Association-of-Paleoanthropology-and-Paleontology/167166840038050, and we’d love for any of you to attend our conferences!

"104","Orkney ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’ My name is Dr Dorothy Graves McEwan and I am the Skara Brae Project Cataloguer at RCAHMS. Skara Brae is the best preserved Neolithic settlement site in Western Europe, and through this distinction has become a World Heritage site beloved by many people the world over. This unique site captured the imagination of antiquarians in the 19th century. It continues to fascinate archaeologists, myself included, to this very day.My first ferry ride to Orkney. Copyright the authorMy reasons for loving Skara Brae are entirely personal. In 2004, in the early days of research for my PhD, I took a trip up with my boyfriend (now husband) to visit archaeological sites in the Highlands.  Eventually, we pointed the car north and just kept driving until we came to John o’Groats. We looked at each other and said, “Why not?”Onto the ferry we went, and the next thing I knew, I was staring at the glorious remains of a settlement that reminded me so much of The Flintstones that I had to laugh. At that moment, standing above House 7, I realised I was entranced by the Scottish Neolithic. It has since become a research passion.Skara Brae; house 7. Copyright RCAHMS (SC346480)An average day of my work currently consists of delving into containers of archive material that was created by archaeologists Dr David V Clarke and Dr Alexandra Shepherd, who in the 1970s excavated material from Skara Brae’s middens. A midden can be considered a fancy archaeological word for the ‘trash’ heap, where literally anything and everything can be found deposited. It is by excavating the midden so carefully that Clarke and Shepherd have been able to open a door into the past that might have otherwise remained closed forever.  By combining their work with Prof V Gordon Childe’s iconic excavations in the 1930s, we know so much more about the daily life of the people who built and lived at Skara Brae.Skara Brae: Vere Gordon Childe in hut 8. Copyright RCAHMS (SC372285)The midden has revealed an extensive diet including plants, shellfish, fish, wild birds, deer, and pigs. They created stone, wooden and bone objects and tools. They even possessed artwork: beautiful pieces such as carved stone balls and incised decorations that appear on some of the stonework.Skara Brae Finds Photograph: Bone and stone objects, including mattocks and carved stone objects.

"107","Written by Sarah Phillips, Built and Cultural Heritage Officer, Clyde and Avon Valley Landscape PartnershipGraveyards capture a sense of place unlike any other historic sites. Wandering within their walls, visitors reading the richly detailed gravestone carvings and inscriptions are rewarded with glimpses of a day-to-day life long since lost.  Today, these historic graveyards are also outdoor museums teeming with life from the fauna and flora which live there.Dr Susan Buckham, Kirkyard ConsultingOver the past few months the Clyde and Avon Valley Landscape Partnership (CAVLP) has been working with graveyard specialist Dr Susan Buckham to develop a conservation strategy and action plan for rural, historic graveyards within the project boundaries. We think these are valuable places, both for their natural and cultural heritage, which need our care and attention.St Patrick’s Churchyard, DalzellIn January, CAVLP commissioned Dr Susan Buckham, of Kirkyard Consulting with Fiona Fisher from the Strathclyde Building Preservation Trust to undertake a conservation strategy for our local kirkyards because..Although graveyards are often found in every community, actually we know surprisingly little about them. Eight different graveyards have been surveyed as part of this project to identify interesting gravestones and buildings and the habitat, aesthetic and amenity values of their landscapes. Fieldwork also measures how well this important resource is faring against the effects of time, the elements and management issues. Studies like this help us better understand what’s unique and special about graveyards so that we can ensure their protection and promotion to a wide audience.Dr Susan Buckham, Kirkyard ConsultingThe burial grounds surveyed all have interesting aspects to focus on, from churchyards such as St. Ninian’s at Stonehouse to cemateries like the 1906 lawn cemetery, also at Stonehouse.  There are small estate burials, such as Mauldslie and  a pet cemetery at Dalzell. Glassford boasts a fine collection of 18th century gravestones, including one with a rare “Tree of Life” symbol carving, while Dalserf has a hogback stone, likely to date to the 10th or 11th century.  We also have a World Heritage Site in our collection, as the non-denominational burial ground for New Lanark, one of our partners,  is on our doorstep (yes, my office is in a World Heritage Site).Where I get to come to work everyday – New Lanark World Heritage SiteToday, I am reviewing the final report and identifying initial actions from the plan to take forward to help achieve CAVLP’s overall aims and objectives.  It really has provided me with a comprehensive plan to take forward, we may not be able to do everything identified but we can definitely add to our understanding of these valuable resources.There has been a considerable amount of work done by different community groups on recording the graveyards in the area, in particularly Stonehouse Heritage Group for their local churchyard and Lanarkshire Family History Society.  Some groups are interested in recording inscriptions; others have focused on the Covenanter graves in the area.  Looking at the report, the first action will be matching information recorded to site plans, and filling in the gaps; include creating site plans for a few of the sites.    A key element of this will be developing a full photographic record for each of the burial grounds.Community involvement will be key in doing this and we hope to pull in individuals and groups already interested in the graveyards, as well as develop new interest in local communities.  Our village network events allow us to chat to communities and hear what is important to them, and certainly the burial grounds are of interest but often people are not sure what they can do to help.John Young, Stonehouse Heritage Group, providing an engaging tour of the churchyard.A new aspect for me, as an archaeologist, is the importance of the kirkyards as “living”; places to encourage a diverse range of wildlife. There has been less information collected about this element of the sites, and so this has been a great opportunity to collaborate with my colleagues in the partnership on how we can involve volunteers and experts to undertake natural heritage surveys to begin to understand their importance as habitats for wildlife.The report also suggests many ways we can promote this information to local communities through interpretation and events.  We have already had one event, where Stonehouse Heritage Group provided a walking tour of the Stonehouse Kirkyard and a series of short talks from a range of speakers including Peder Aspen, a geologist who spoke about the issues of stone conservation and the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis about raising funds for their conservation work.So today, will hopefully result in me moving forward on what we can do next.  The passion and enthusiasm from our consultants has really brought these sites to life for me.  I hope through the developing projects with communities we can do the same for others, and at the same time update and enhance the historic record for the CAVLP area. The Living Kirkyards in the Clyde and Avon Valleys by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"108","It seems that little has change in the last year of my life!  For Day of Archaeology 2012, I posted about my PhD research on medieval manorial accounts.  And here I am again, sitting in front of a microfilm reader in a windowless room of Queen’s University Belfast’s Library.  While some of my colleagues are away surveying buildings in the sun, I’m stuck inside trying to decipher medieval handwriting. Despite the less glamorous nature of my research, it is just as exciting and interesting.  The manorial accounts record many aspects of the daily lives of people in the fourteenth century, letting us almost experience the medieval world.  My research is specifically looking at the buildings of the manorial courtyards and farmsteads (or curiae).  The accounts contain lots of details about the types of buildings and construction materials; with this information I can reconstruct the appearance of the buildings and the manorial complexes.  Many of the manorial buildings would have been much larger than the average peasant could ever own and were often constructed from expensive materials that had to be brought to the manor.  So far my research has shown that lords liked to spend more money on the buildings that they used (such as the hall, chamber and chapel) and to make these appear very different from the agricultural buildings that sat alongside them.  The accounts also show how luxurious some manors were.  The abbot of Bury-St-Edmunds constructed an extensive collection of buildings at Redgrave in Suffolk to let him enjoy hunting with dogs and hawks. As well as my research, I’ve spent the week organising a conference session, thinking of a conference paper and finishing a chapter for a book.  So, even thought I am only halfway through my PhD (and doing it part-time means I’ve another 3 years), I’ve lots of work to develop my research and try to apply it to the wider field of medieval archaeology and not just have a pile of case studies in a box on my desk.  The exciting life that is academic research means that, although I’m stuck in a windowless box today looking at medieval parchment on a screen, I’ll soon get the opportunity to present my work to other archaeologists in exotic locations like Aberdeen and Leeds.  Maybe next year when I post “from the field”, I’ll actually be out surveying one of my manors.The Medieval buildings & Medieval life by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"109","Written by Sarah Sall, Volunteer and Outreach Coordinator, Clyde and Avon Valley Landscape PartnershipHaving attended an excellent training day by the Ancient Tree Hunt I felt inspired to try and link two aspects of our Clyde and Avon Valley Landscape Partnership’s (CAVLP) work – the natural heritage and a newly understood aspect of its cultural heritage. As a result today I am sending out my second Ancient Tree Hunt schedule to some eagerly awaiting volunteers, who are going to help us record many special trees in the designed landscape of Dalzell Estate in North Lanarkshire and the neighbouring RSPB Scotland nature reserve of Baron’s Haugh.Looking at maps at the new Search Room at New Lanark World Heritage SiteThis session will build on the success of my first attempt, which for me as a practical conservationist of the natural environment, involved guiding volunteers through the newly launched Search Room at New Lanark World Heritage Site. Thankfully I have a very knowledgeable archaeologist working alongside me, and so with her help and the wonderful induction by staff from the New Lanark Trust, myself and the volunteers learnt about the wonders of first edition maps, using famous artists paintings (admittedly with a pinch of salt in some cases) and photographs. Added to this I had the world of SCRAN and E-hive opened up to me. I obviously have an untapped enthusiasm for this sort of work and really enjoyed having hands on access. Of course the Ancient Tree Hunt pages on The Woodlands Trust website gives you access to first edition maps and modern aerial shots so as you can see if there’s the possibility of the trees of the past still being present in our landscape now, but having actual maps to run your fingers over makes for a more tactile link to the past – even if they were copies.The following day we headed out to look for the ancient trees of the Falls Of Clyde National Nature Reserve, managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  As suspected we found old Douglas fir trees and a wonderful Sessil oak, complete with “chicken of the woods” fungi.Chicken of the woods fungiSessil oak So here I am gearing up for our second Ancient Tree Hunt and I get to re-pay our archaeologist by sharing the data collection techniques of all this research, bring on the tape measures, GPS, clipboards and thermos.  Thankfully it’s not backbreaking work like digging and spending time out amongst the trees is always energising and enjoyable in my opinion.  The Ancient Tree Hunts: Linking the Cultural and the Natural, both Past and Present by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"111","After the fieldwork has wrapped up and everyone comes home, there are still tasks yet to be accomplished.  Today I am performing the rather unglamourous and mundane chore of creating site forms for a batch of new sites we stumbled across a few weeks ago.  These forms, which document pertinent information such as location, features, material, etc., are produced for every site and isolated find that an archaeologist stumbles upon here in the States and they vary in form and complexity from state to state.  When you are assigned to a multi-state project (re: pipelines and high voltage transmission lines), you will quickly become proficient in upwards of half a dozen variations on the basic site form.Examples of site forms (Colorado, Wyoming, Washington State, Montana and North Dakota).It takes very little time to become proficient at creating site forms.  They quickly become something you can do en masse while listening to music, podcasts and such to reduce the tedium that comes with the process.  However, you have to aware at all times that the form you are creating will be associated with its site for posterity.  It will assist generations of yet unborn archaeologists to find the site once again and may provide crucial data for future studies and research.  In sum, when you are creating a site form (mundane and dull as it may seem) you are forging the first link in a chain that may span years, decades or even centuries.The The Necessary and the Mundane: Site Forms by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"112","As a curator at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex in Moundsville, West Virginia, I find myself asking this question often, “…and just where did that come from?”  This facility houses thousands of boxes of archaeological artifacts, many of which were excavated as far back as fifty to sixty years ago. Most of the boxes had been moved here and there throughout the state of West Virginia until our facility was built in 2008.  With all of that “moving,” it is no wonder that some of the artifacts’ “stories” have been lost to time.  On some days, I feel like I’m conducting archaeology on archaeology.Just yesterday, I opened a box that had simply been labeled “Museum.”  It contained multiple artifacts including both prehistoric and historic material, some from identifiable sites and others with no provenience at all.  Many of the artifacts still had residue from where they had been mounted in an exhibit years ago.  Being a historical archaeologist in a state with such an overwhelming prehistoric archaeology presence can be tough sometimes, so you can imagine my utter joy when I retrieved a few late eighteenth/early nineteenth century artifacts from the box.  There were bone handled forks, tombac buttons, hand painted polychrome pearlware sherds, and musket flints…oh my!  Lucky for me, there was a tiny accession number written on a few of the flint pieces.  What a fortunate find indeed! With a little more digging, pardon the pun, I was able to find out that the artifacts had been excavated from a site in the summer of 1970 by Ms. Bettye Broyles (of St. Albans fame) and a team of students from a science camp being held in the Pocahontas County area.  The site was described as a farmstead that had been inhabited from the late eighteenth century to no later than 1810.  After even more investigating, I discovered that we have six more boxes of artifacts from the site, all patiently waiting to be rehoused into new boxes and bags!  What a discovery! Bone handled forks, Copper Alloy buckle, and metal buttons from a site in Pocahontas County, West VirginiaI am looking forward to when I have some “free” time to continue my research into this surprising early historical archaeology site from the Mountain State.  Perhaps if you visit the museum in the next couple of months, there will even be a display of the ‘treasures’ that were excavated there some 43 years ago, and I will be able to tell you even more of the story behind these wonderful, early American artifacts.The …And Just Where Did That Come From? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"113","Priniatikos Pyrgos from the hillsToday is the last day of the season at Priniatikos Pyrgos, an archaeological project, which has been running in East Crete since 2005. Currently, it is operated under the auspices of the Irish Institute of Hellenic Studies at Athens but it began as an American/Greek project. Excavation at the Bronze Age to modern coastal promontory site ceased in 2010 and since 2011 the project members have returned to study the vast quantities of material and site recordings that were gathered during the 6 years of excavation.My main role with the PP project over the years has been to handle its digital data record. I’ve grown up (archaeologically) at PP and so while I have always tried to approach my work here professionally, I also have a sentimental attachment to a lot of the material that a see make its way into the site’s digital repository. Today has mainly been about ensuring that the digital work for the season is signed off on and committed in a way that we can continue to work with over the coming months in the off season. In many ways, this is one of the main reasons that people employ digital practice into their archaeological workflow: digital technologies allow for the continued interpretation of a site when the site is off limits in a physical sense. And when you are working with material from a site in a country that you are not a resident of then a strong digital data foundation becomes all the more compelling. The introduction of more novel and sometimes more innovative techniques such as the 3D capture of material and the maintenance of multi-dimensional datasets (spatiality, interpretation, quantitative) provide an increasingly engaging remote site working environment. I am currently doing a PhD in the area of digital data management (specifically on the topic of where big data, the semantic web and archaeology collide) so my time here aligns well with my work back home too.Besides my digital responsibilities, this season I have also been asked to look at the project’s loom weight collection. Now for someone like myself who tends to only handle the material record when I dig it out of the ground this was a great opportunity to experience the digital and material record through the eyes of an end-user. In the past, I have been perhaps prone to treating archaeological data too much as a generic data type and so to be put in a position where I needed to engage with the data as a means to an interpretive end was a very interesting and helpful experience. And it also added that bit of archaeological romanticism that for me at least is not often associated with the post-ex process.Well, the final archive backups are on the go as I write this – they will probably run right through the night. This weekend will be one of goodbyes and my mind will have to turn to the lands of the north and normality. I’ve greatly enjoyed this season. I’ve gotten to excavate at a new site (at Petras a couple of weeks ago) and I have been able to engage for the first time in any sort of meaningful way with the post-ex material record. And over the last few weeks a couple of interesting ideas have occurred to me that I will bring back to my PhD research when I return to Dublin.

"114","Time to make a cup of tea and reflect on what I’ve been doing today…I recently started work as a post-doctoral researcher on an AHRC funded joint British Museum / Leicester University research project looking at Roman coin hoards. It’s a bit of a change for me from juggling two part-time jobs in the Department of Coins and Medals (cataloguing Greek and Roman coins in the Museum’s collection and dealing with Roman coin hoards going through the Treasure process). I’m enjoying the chance this project presents to take a step back and start to make sense of the data I’ve helped to create over the past few years, although I confess I slightly miss the big piles of corroded coins.The last corpus of Roman coin hoards was published in 2000 and represented the life’s work of Anne S. Robertson. Since then there has been a steady increase in the number of Roman coin hoards reported as Treasure. The British Museum has a large archive of files containing detailed information on Treasure cases, many of which have not been published in detail. I am collating information for a new database on Roman coin hoards from Britain, starting with Robertson and the data held by the British Museum (some of which is now on the PAS website).Today I have been sitting in front of a spreadsheet, continuing with the process of cleaning up the data and trying to get it into a consistent format. There are various problems thrown up by the existing record, from practical ones, such as the changes in British parish names and boundaries to more philosophical ones , such as what do we mean by a hoard?A hoard on the PAS database.As I go through Robertson’s data, I am increasingly in awe of the amount of work she undertook on this project without the on-line tools we have come to rely on. Web searches, mapping tools, on-line HER records and digitised newspapers mean it is now often easy to access information she gathered the hard way, but the hours she put in visiting museum collections and looking at material are so valuable still. Some of the records are less useful than others (my current favourite account of a hoard is “A cony drawing his yerth betwyxt Folkestan and Hyve did cast up antique mony” (J. Leland, Itinerary (1535-43), VIII, fol. 141)) but I am excited about the depth of contextual information we have even for some early finds.

The sheltered bay is a natural harbour  and has been used as an anchorage throughout history; during the two World Wars it accommodated the Royal Navy Home Fleet and mthe Atlantic Fleet. It was also the testing area for the ‘Lily’ floating airfield towards the end of  WW2.  Its strategic qualities were recognised even further back in time. It played a role in the last Norse invasion of Scotland in 1263, which culminated in the Battle of Largs on the North Ayrshire coast. The  Norwegian king was the overlord of the Hebrides and Islands in the Clyde, these having been settled by the Norse from the 9th century onwards.Battle of Largs Monument. View from W. Copyright RCAHMS (SC1111416) During the 13th century the Scottish kings started to flex their muscles and sought to extend their domain over the Isles. This led to the Norwegian King Hakon leading an invasion to forcibly protect his claim.  The Saga of King Hakon Hakonsson records the Norse fleet sheltering in Lamlash Bay while negotiations between the two sides took place. These broke down and the Norsemen went marauding along the Clyde, even sailing up Loch Long and portaging their ships across the isthmus at Arrochar to go raiding in Loch Lomond. Events came to a head when several of the Norse’ ships were blown ashore at Largs during a storm, leading to a skirmish between the two sides. This minor conflict is remembered as the  Battle of Largs, and although the Norse may have won the day they lost the war, as Hakon died on his return voyage to Norway and control of the Hebrides was ceded to the Scots just three years after the battle. A monument to this Scottish victory in the form of a tower (known locally as “The Pencil”) was erected in Largs in 1912.St Molaise’s Cave, Holy Island, Arran. View of cave and interior.

St Molaise’s Cave on Holy Island is traditionally the hermitage of a sixth century saint and may have been a place of pilgrimage. The roof and sides of the cave are covered in many inscribed crosses and runic inscriptions dating from the 11th to 12th century. One of these reads “Vigleikr the marshal carved”, and the saga records a certain Vigleik Priestson as one of the captains of the Norse fleet.Scanned image of drawing showing detail of runic inscription VIII in St Molaise’s Cave, Holy Island, Arran Page 64, figure A of ‘Gazetteer of Early Medieval Sculpture in the West Highlands and Islands’. Copyright RCAHMS (SC580820) These were not the first of the Norse to have visited these parts either. At Kingscross Point, jutting out at the left of the photograph, are the remains of a viking burial, which contained a coin dating from the ninth century as well as burnt human bone and boat rivets, perhaps indicating a Viking Period cremation. So it’s a very interesting region where both the start of the Viking Period in Scotland and the end of Norse overlordship of the Isles can be evidenced, both through archaeology and the historic record.  This Norse heritage is still celebrated by communities on the Clyde, from the Arran Viking Longship Society, the Largs Viking Festival, and the Hidden Heritage Project. This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Brian Wilkinson (RCAHMS) – North Ayrshire by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"116","Hello!  If you’re reading this perhaps you want to know what it’s like to be a HERO (Historic Environment Record Officer), just for this one day.  (I know it’s a bit tenuous but I wanted a quote for my title and I love David Bowie, so…!)I last blogged as part of the Day of Archaeology in 2011.  If you want to read my blog from back then please read a day in the life of a HERO.  There’s a fair bit there that I don’t really want to cover again, like how I became a HERO.  I think today I’ll just blog about what I’m up to.View from my office, County Hall, LeicestershireI work for Leicestershire County Council in the Historic & Natural Environment Team (part of Planning, Historic & Natural Environment, so we sit with various planning officers). The other people in my team consist of a war memorials project officer, conservation officer, 2 planning archaeologists and our team leader – we’re also in the same team as several ecologists. There used to be more of us but due to the ubiquitous cuts that’s the team at the moment.  The conservation officer and our team leader don’t work full time, also because of the cuts.  So they’re not here today.I’m in charge of the Historic Environment Record for Leicestershire & Rutland, which is basically a database that attempts to record all known archaeological remains and historic buildings in the county.The first job of the day is to check the Heritage Gateway upload that I set running last night. About 70% of our HER records are available on-line through the Gateway (our Heritage Gateway update page details what’s on-line at the moment). Yesterday I added some new records (and edited some old ones), so I thought I’d better upload them!  The new records include a rather interesting medieval cruck-framed house, 5-7, Market Place, Whitwick (MLE20894) that is due to be demolished as part of a scheme to build a new Co-op.  (It’s not listed.) Our planning archaeologists have been commenting on the scheme, hence the reports that have provided me with new sites.Then it’s time to do some fun map regression!  I love the part of my job that’s basically detective work, though sometimes it’s infuriating not to get definitive answers to questions…  Yesterday the Principal Planning Archaeologist brought several things in Ashby-de-la-Zouch to my attention.  First is an early ‘tramway’ that ran from the Ashby Canal to Ticknall.  This was on the HER already, but the mapping wasn’t quite right.  Then there are a whole bunch of industrial sites dating from the C18th-C20th.Historic maps (1735, 1837, 1888) and HER extract for Ashby-de-la-ZouchThe sites are (the links will work when I’ve done the next Gateway upload!):Willesley Basin to Ticknall Tramway (MLE16992) – an early tramway dating from the late C18th.Glue and Leather Manufactory (MLE20899) – a C19th factory – leather was a major industry in Ashby, parts of it must have been quite stinky!Watermill and mill pond (MLE20900) – only shown on the 1735 map, they have disappeared by the early C19th.Pond at Brookside/Brook Street (MLE20901) – a large pond is shown at the convergence of two parts of the Gilwiskaw Brook on the 1735 map.C19th waterworks (MLE20902) – waterworks constructed in the later C19th by the Ashby Local Board.C19th/C20th Gas Works (MLE20903) – gas works shown on the 1837 plan, still in use well into the C20th.Castle Soap Works (MLE20904) – built c.1900 and still a soap factory, another major industry in the town.The next job is something that brings in money – a commercial data search.  Searches are requested by land agents and solicitors as well as commercial archaeology units, to help inform land purchases, planning decisions and as part of fieldwork.  For a fee, I send various digital files (maps, GIS files, gazetteers etc) out containing all the archaeological sites and historic buildings on the HER.  (Non-commercial enquiries are free.)  Interesting sites in Appleby Magna, where this search was for, include Moat House (MLE10939), a C16th house that sits within a moat.  The moated site, along with formal gardens, fishponds and village earthworks, is a Scheduled Monument (National Heritage List Entry No. 1011458).As a fun Friday afternoon activity I think I’ll go through a book I’ve just bought (another HER officer recommended it to me).  It’s called ‘Actions Stations: Military airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands’, by Bruce Barrymore Halpenny.  We’ve been trying to put World War I sites onto the HER in advance of the First World War Centenary next year and I’m hoping it can add a bit more information.First World War Short 184 seaplane built at the Brush Works, LoughboroughReaching the end of the day, the book doesn’t contain much First World War information (I’m up to ‘L’ in the gazetteer), but it does have some information about the Brush Works at Loughborough (MLE8697), which built aircraft in both the First and Second World Wars, and Loughborough Meadows (MLE15968), where they test flew their planes. The updated information will be on the Heritage Gateway after my next upload.As you can see, for an ‘archaeology database’ the HER contains quite a few records that are pretty modern, as well as things like castles and medieval houses.  It certainly makes for an interesting job, learning about all sorts of different things on a daily basis!  You never quite know what the day will hold…The We can be heroes, just for one day by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"118","This week MOLA archaeologists have been working with members of the public to excavate Stepney City Farm as part of a Crossrail community archaeology project, which goes on until Saturday 27 July.Briefing our volunteers for the excavationThe sun shines over Stepney City Farm in the East End of London where the atmosphere today was relaxed and eco-conscientious with a shared community spirit. Volunteers, school groups and families visit this working haven situated in the ‘village’ of Stepney, a stone’s throw from St Dunstan’s Anglican Church. We’re looking for the remains of the Tudor palace known as Worcester House, occupied by Henry Somerset, the Marquis of Worcester in the 16th century; a brick-tower gatehouse, along with many other significant archaeological finds that have already been uncovered by MOLA.Dave helping one of our volunteers identify findsTemperatures soared to 27 degrees as staff and volunteers excavated the remains of the Tudor palace whilst we listened to the hee-haws, oinks and clucks of hot but contented farmyard animals, surrounded by trees and many varieties of herbs and colourful flowering plants.Hee-hawThe allotments, buildings and pathways were designed from recycled materials; bunting swayed in the breeze overhead, a flourishing and successful outcome to a plot of land where squatters once stood their ground and won!The Stepney City Farm allotments complete with upcycled plastic bottle greenhouseThe vision underground, however, is very different.  Dark and eerie caverns and utility tunnels weave between London’s tube and rail lines at depths exceeding 35 metres.  These caverns under Stepney Green are some of the largest mined and constructed tunnels in Europe with many people employed by Crossrail, below street level, in protective clothing, oblivious to the temperatures above. This heavy and dangerous work will continue after we and our volunteers move on.Back on the surface, MOLA has an archaeological excavation underway that has exposed a ditch, moat and boundary walls of Worcester House, otherwise known as ‘King John’s Palace’.Examining the finds from a featureKaren and volunteer washing findsArchaeological small finds include a copper dress pin and remains of a Tudor shoe from the moat, glass beaker bases from the cess pit and a bone ivory ring from Garden Street.

"119","I have been working at the University of York since November 2012, as the holder of a one-year IFA/HLF Workplace Learning Bursary. My days here are often split between tasks for the Archaeology Data Service (ADS) and the e-journal Internet Archaeology.Work for the journal can involve proof-reading articles for publication, looking at proposals and writing HTML mark-up in order to prepare the articles for online publication. This really helps you get to grips with what the authors put across, and because of the electronic nature of the journal, it’s amazing to see the innovative ways that data and concepts can be presented. Whereas traditional print journals are confined mainly to text and images, Internet Archaeology regularly deals with animations, videos, 3D visualisations and other media, which all comes together to provide some really rich, interesting content.As part of the submissions process, Internet Archaeology articles have a digital archive with the Archaeology Data Service, and for the past few months I have mainly been busy with preserving and archiving the digital files that make up individual articles. Depending on the content, this can be quite a challenge, especially when you start to delve back to the mid-90s origins of the journal (some days I can almost hear the dial-up tone), and involves making sure all file formats are suitable for deposit under the ADS Depositors’ Guidelines, converting files which aren’t, and making sure the finished archive is suitable for long-term preservation. As I’ve alluded to, many of the deprecated formats that the journal once dealt with don’t fit comfortably within the ADS archives, and I’ve bothered many a member of staff with questions about MATLAB files or animated GIFs.As I have reached the end of this process (for the time being), the focus of my work here has shifted to the Grey Literature Library, held here at the ADS. This is a collection of unpublished reports that are produced by archaeological contractors relating to projects they are carrying out, which are then uploaded via the Online Access to the Index of Archaeological Investigations project, better known as OASIS.  Thousands of events occur across the country every year, and a great deal of data is produced, so it’s important to be able to make this data available for future research. The Grey Literature Library is a fantastic tool for this, and as new reports are uploaded every day, there is always plenty of work to be done.So today, my day has mainly revolved around adding reports to the library, and transferring the file-level metadata so they can be accessed easily. The reports are copied to our server, and the accession recorded in the internal Collections Management System (CMS), which also documents what processes are carried out on any files—this is important, as it allows other archivists to see any changes that have been made if the archived needs to be revisited. I’ve found that documentation at every level is a key part of working at the ADS.Most of the grey literature reports are deposited in PDF format, which have to then be converted for preservation and dissemination into PDF/A, an archival format (you can read more about the intricacies of PDF formats in the ADS blog). The conversion of PDFs can be quite a time-consuming task, and in fact the lion’s share of the process is taken up by these conversions. After all the conversions are complete, and the archived files are safely stored, more file-level metadata is generated, and the reports are available to be accessed. So data relating to archaeological events that were once consigned to filing cabinets now have a new, digital life!The Working at the ADS/Internet Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"120","Moray. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’My name is Adam Welfare and I am an archaeologist with a special interest in stone circles. Earlier this year I received a letter from a lady who had recently visited a stone circle at Lynagowan, deep in the hills south Forres, which she had first seen when she was a girl many years ago. However, to her surprise and immense disappointment she discovered that it had been removed from the field in which it once stood. She ended the letter with a request ‘Please can you find out what happened to it’. The letter raised a number of interesting issues, including the question of whether the stone circle had been correctly classified, what happened to it, and on broader scale about the vulnerability of archaeological sites in general to erosion and destruction. As far as the first point is concerned, the site was initially recorded in 1972 by Ian Keillor, an experienced amateur archaeologist from Elgin, but as far as is known his interpretation of the site was never verified or refined. There are no contemporary photographs and Keillor’s notes lack the detail that could have proven the site’s authenticity. Moreover, the field in which the circle is alleged to have stood is bordered by a 19th century farmstead and a former public road. It is therefore surprising that it escaped the notice of the Ordnance Survey as well as local historians for so long. As to what happened to the site, it is fairly clear that the stones have been removed to ease the task of cultivation. A number of images posted on the internet suggest that they may have been simply pushed over the edge of the river terrace to the east of the field.Extract from first edition (1870-71) Ordnance Survey 6-inch-to-mile map. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Many archaeological sites are fairly slight in nature and as long ago as the 1840s John Stuart of Inchbreck, Professor of Greek at Aberdeen University, complained about the loss of antiquities resulting from agricultural improvement. Pressure from him and others of like mind eventually led to the mapping of ancient monuments like Innesmill by the Ordnance Survey, a responsibility that was subsequently passed to RCAHMS in 1983. Although many stone circles in Scotland must have been destroyed without any sort of record, details of more than 500 can be consulted using the Commission’s Canmore search engine. This record owes much to the work of the Ordnance Survey and there can be little doubt of the important role it played in documenting and preserving what is a vitally important part of the nation’s heritage. The story of the Lynagowan site is a salutary reminder that much recording work still needs to be done and that attrition remains a very real issue. However, we can be consoled to some extent by knowing that in general terms Scotland’s stone circles have never been better cared for and that many are now protected by an effective legal framework.Easter Aquhorthies recumbent stone circle. Oblique aerial view of stone circle, taken from WNW. Copyright RCAHMS (DP083018)In researching stone circles in NE Scotland over the past few years, not least for my book, Great Crowns of Stone, I have been struck by how few remain intact. The recumbent stone circle of Easter Aquhorthies is a remarkable exception, but even so its mid-19th century owner considered it prudent to enclose it within a low wall. His counterpart at Pitglassie had no interest in his recumbent stone circle and instead extracted the stones and piled them in a heap ready to be taken away. Once cleared, such stones were usually put to work around the farm. At Bankhead several were reused in a field wall and one at Corrie Cairn was employed as a gate-post. Likewise, at Cairnfauld one supports the gable of a barn, while at Colmeallie another was built into a now ruined cart shed. However, sometimes a single stone would be spared demolition for use as a cattle rubbing stone – as happened at Peat Hill.A general view of the demolished stone circle taken by the photographer James Ritchie at the beginning of the 20th century.

"121","There is no “typical” day as the Station Assistant at the Blytheville Station of the Arkansas Archeological Survey.  I can find myself doing anything from initial site survey, to mapping, to excavating, to lab work, to final report write-ups.  So I thought a more fun blog would be to show you around my area of NE Arkansas and the kinds of places that I find myself throughout my days.  We have some amazing archeology out here and I’m lucky to get to work on it every day.As a general rule I start out my day by coming out to my office.  This summer we planted two gardens out front as part of our public outreach/engagement.  One is a tenant farmer garden and the other is a native (3 sisters) garden.  These two gardens show people not only how the crops differ, but also how planting techniques differ between cultures and time periods.Tenant farmer garden (left), Native garden (right), Survey Station building in the backgroundWe also have an up-and-coming museum in Blytheville called the Delta Gateway Museum that is located on Main Street in the old Kress department store building.  We have loaned some of our collections to the museum for display and we work with them on various events and displays throughout the year.Delta Gateway MuseumMississippian Pottery on display at the Delta Gateway MuseumWe have more than just a museum in NE Arkansas though.  We also have a lot of archeological sites.  Despite being so close to the Mississippi River and having it meander and destroy most very old archeological sites over the years, we do still have some Archaic (8500BC-600BC) sites!  Though they don’t look like much during the summer while the field is in beans…Archaic Site, NE ArkansasWe also have a lot of small, nearly abandoned historic cemeteries.  You can be driving down the road and just run across one.  Someone is keeping this mowed, but the headstones are falling down and the church that was likely near it is long gone.Historic CemeteryJust down the road from our office is the city of Armorel, named for Arkansas (Ar), Missouri (mo), and Robert E Lee Wilson (a local cotton Barron in the early days)(rel).  They don’t have a huge headquarters there anymore, but this is their old headquarters building and also possibly the company store.Armorel HeadquartersArmorel is just inside the levee that protects the low lying ground of NE Arkansas from flooding on the Mississippi.  Seeing the levee makes you really think about the days before the levee was built and how people must have constantly worried about the river flooding, which would have wiped out everything in the area.Mississippi River LeveeThe huge Mississippian site called Knappenberger is also in our area of NE Arkansas.  It used to have giant mounds on it, but farming over the years has reduced them to hills on the landscape.  Here they are planted for the season.Knappenberger SiteAnother nearby Mississippian site has a mound that hasn’t been plowed over.  It has been severely looted over the years, but not taken down in the same way that plowing does.  It is called the Chickasawba mound and has a large site associated with it.Chickasawba MoundBack to our historic roots, there are a few shotgun houses still standing around the area.  Why are they named shotgun houses?  Maybe because they are long and thin, or maybe because if you take your shotgun and shoot, you can reach from the front of the house to the back through the doorways in the center.  Most are uninhabited, but this one has a satellite dish…Shotgun house…with satellite dishIn the more recent past, the NE Arkansas area was home to Eaker Airforce Base, where B52′s were stationed during the Cold War.  The base is now closed, but many of it’s buildings, including our office, are still extant; as is the razorwire on the top of the fences and some of the old guard towers.  A bit of a chilly reminder of no-too-distant American history.Razor-wire topped fenceGuard tower near bunkersSo there you have it, a fly-by tour of archeology in NE Arkansas as seen by the Station Assistant at the Blytheville Station of the Arkansas Archeological Survey.  This is an amazing area with so much archeology that no one could ever possibly get bored.  Come out and see it for yourself!The A Day of Archeology in NE Arkansas by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

In hot and humid days such as today, you can even smell the salty see in every corridor of the building. My aim for today is to write a big chunk of the chapter I’m working on these days, which is the spatial analysis of a site called “Artisans’ Quarters” in Mochlos, Crete (Bronze Age!). And trying to scape the temptation to jump into the sea!By “spatial analysis” I mean something pretty simple: in a given settlement, I identify where people performed specific activities and then I see if people did mingle a lot or, on the contrary, their everyday lifes developed in segregated spaces. I am specially interested in the cooks, those people who had to cook everyday to ensure the survival of the group. So I’ve basically spent the last years trying to find kitchens, hearths, cooking pots, querns, faunal remains… to have a glimpse of their lifes. But, for my Phd thesis, I work with published materials, which means that my quest is basically in the libraries and work is done in front of a computer.This year is being specially hard because I must finish my thesis and cannot dedicate time to the fun part of the work: “the field”. Normally, every summer I participate in different excavation projects in Crete, where the office dissapears and you get “to touch soil”. Now I miss it. I miss my friends, I miss the landscape, I miss the work, and I miss Greece. Hopefully, next summer I will be able to resume my duties there, until then… writing, writing, writing.The Writing about the “Cooks” by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The tall red-brick buildings and the arcading create an impressive structure that housed one of Scotland’s most important industrial processes.We were asked to produce survey drawings of the ground plan of the site, pithead tub-circuit plan and the North, South, West and East elevations which was an extensive amount of survey work but shows the layout of the buildings to scale and generated a good comprehensive record of the complex.Survey drawing of the ground plan of Lady Victoria Colliery, drawn by the author.

"124","Somewhere along the way, in addition to becoming a practicing field archaeologist and educator, I became a writer of archaeology. I write year round as a secondary activity, almost hobby-like, off the side of my desk, while teaching three courses per term at Capilano University in western Canada, and directing archaeology field projects for seven weeks each May and June.July is typically devoted primarily to writing.  In addition to writing this post, today I am prioritizing two other writing projects, but will work on several, and spend some time on social media and professional networks  as well.  Project 1 is drafting my July, 2013 column for the American Anthropological Association’s on-line ‘Anthropology News’ where I have been writing a monthly column called ‘Archeology in North America’ for the past 22 months. I am drafting it today with the intent of revising and submitting it early next week. It should appear on-line July 29, 30, or 31. The topic of the July column is on the implications of DNA studies in archaeology, especially in regard to perhaps superseding archaeology in support of Indigenous claims of use and occupancy of territories in North America and tracing ancestry.Project 2 is a continuation of working on the third edition of ‘The First Nations of British Columbia: An Anthropological Survey’.  There is much to update in regard to archaeology. The last edition was published in 2007 and since that time there have been about 17,000 archaeology sites added to the inventory of prehistoric sites in the province.  Revisions to this book have been my primary project in July thus far. I will submit my completed manuscript in mid August, with an anticipated publication date in Spring, 2014.I typically like to intersperse hours on some writing projects with short bursts of energy on other, unrelated writing projects. Today, this includes about 15-30 minutes each on (i) the second edition of ‘Introducing Archaeology’, a core textbook for introductory archaeology classes in colleges and universities (I will submit my completed manuscript at end of August, with an anticipated publication date in Spring, 2014); (ii)  a draft of a paper on archaeology I am presenting at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association in Chicago in November ; and (iii)  a paper for an on-line publication on contemporary discard and waste behaviour.In addition to writing, I will visit Twitter several time to see what is happening in the world of archaeology. I am a big advocate of using Twitter to share things related to archaeology. I sometimes find it is hard to believe I have more than 4,000 tweets and more than 1,000 followers. My Twitter profile is here. I can be followed at @bobmuckle.I will also continue my ongoing, never-ending promotion of my field project. I will contemplate updating the Facebook page for the Seymour Valley Archaeology Project I direct and answer some email enquiries about a 12 minute video of the project I posted on-line to various Facebook pages, groups, and listserves yesterday.

"126","Billy MacRae, RCAHMSA CUT ABOVE!What is the connection between Petra, Nazca and Greenock?Any ideas? No, well, I didn’t either until recently, but the answer is…they all have extensive aqueducts.I’m Billy MacRae and I work as a Landscape Assessment Officer at RCAHMS and what I get excited about in archaeology is that it is not just about the extraordinary and exceptional, but also the ordinary and everyday things which were part of the experience of life in the past.Inverclyde ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’The Loch Thom-Overton aqueduct, or “Greenock Cut”, as it is sometimes known, is a fantastic example of 19th century engineering and ingenuity. The Greenock Cut is also a symbol of the desire to harness and manipulate the landscape for what many believed was the advancement of society.Loch Thom and Greenock Cut. Copyright RCAHMS (DP035861)The complete water system comprises reservoirs, sluices, workers’ bothies and obviously, the water course itself. It was devised and built to power the industries in and around Greenock and also provide clean drinking water for an expanding population. The fact that this aqueduct provided Greenock’s water supply until 1971, a working life of over 140 years, is a testament to the skills and hard work of those who designed, built and maintained it. The industrial heritage of Inverclyde, the mills, factories and refineries were only made possible by civil engineering works like the Greenock Cut.Looking towards Greenock from Loch Thom-Overton aqueduct. Copyright RCAHMS (DP 035862)The other great thing about landscape archaeology and the Loch Thom-Overton aqueduct in particular, is that you don’t need to visit a museum or sit in the bottom of a muddy trench to appreciate it. There is a pathway which runs the length of the aqueduct and forms part of the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park. This landscape bears witness to many thousands of years of human activity. While you are there, you could also look out for the remains of rig-and-furrow cultivation, hut-circles, cup-and-ring marked rocks, and there’s even a Roman road and fortlet not too far away.As for Petra and Nazca (try Googling “Nabatean aqueduct” and “Nazca puquios”), they are pretty impressive too, but not quite so easy to visit for a stroll at the weekend.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Billy MacRae (RCAHMS) – Inverclyde by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"127","The Smithsonian’s Human Origins Program is excited to participate in the Day of Archaeology 2013!Our research scientists conduct field research at prehistoric sites in Africa (Kenya: Olorgesailie and Ol Pejeta Conservancy; Tanzania: Engare Sero) and Asia (China: Nihewan Basin and Bose Basin; Indonesia: Flores).  Today we’ll bring you into a day in the life of Dr. Rick Potts, the Director of the Human Origins Program. Today Rick is in the National Museums of Kenya, studying fossils and artifacts excavated at the site of Olorgesailie in southern Kenya.  But to give you a flavor of what fieldwork at Olorgesailie entails, we’ll be going back in the past — just two years, to July 26th 2011, when the excavations were going strong. Here is a modified version of Rick’s blog entry for that day from our Olorgesailie field blog: http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/east-african-research/olorgesailie-field-blog/olorgesailie-2011-field-season/day-31-july-26Rick says:One of the big-picture studies we do at Olorgesailie focuses on how the landscape changed over time, all the way back to the beginning of the sediment record more than 1 million years ago.  This area of the southern Kenya Rift Valley has the most precisely dated record of archeological and fossil remains in the world for the past 1 million years.  There is only one major gap in the time sequence, between the Olorgesailie and Oltulelei Formations – a gap that resulted from widespread erosion in the region between about 490,000 and 340,000 years.  But other than that, Olorgesailie presents a pretty continuous record from the handaxe era up to and beyond the time of the African origin of our species, Homo sapiens.My geologist colleague, Kay Behrensmeyer, and I have been studying landscape change in the region throughout the entire time period recorded in the Olorgesailie sedimentary layers.  Kay’s short visit draws to an end tomorrow, as she heads back to Nairobi and flies home to her family.  So we spent the morning going over the evidence for landscape change in the younger beds, the Oltulelei Formation, which includes the oldest Middle Stone Age excavations at BOK-2 and nearby sites.  Let me provide a couple of images that can help clarify what I mean by ‘landscape change’.Deep erosion along the river unveils many stratigraphic layers. Studying these layers helps us reconstruct how the Olorgesailie landscape changed over hundreds of thousands of years.For example, in the first image, you can see thick white bands and gray bands – where the upper layers were laid down on top of (and thus after) the ones below.  The white layer just above the line of rocks and trees is a thick layer of diatomite (look forward to me talking about diatoms tomorrow!).  The diatoms in the diatomite show that a large lake once existed at that point in time in the Olorgesailie area.  The gray band above it is a thick volcanic sand, which show two things – that there was a volcanic eruption in the vicinity, and that the debris from the eruption filled up wide stream channels that had cut across the region after the lake dried up.  So, count ‘em up:  that’s three major landscape changes.  First, the lake was present and then dried up.  Second, the dried-out landscape was eroded and water channels crossed the area.  Third, after a nearby volcano erupted, the ash and pumice and gravel was carried into the Olorgesailie region and it filled up the channels to form yet another, different kind of landscape.One thing I’m especially interested in is how early humans responded to these big transitions in the environment.  Stone tools were the early humans’ version of a business card – they left the tools behind as if to say ‘We were here!’  Thus we use the stone tools to indicate whether our early ancestors were very successful or not in surviving the major shifts in the landscape, or perhaps repopulating the landscape after an especially difficult time.  Just think, 10 centimeters of volcanic ash blanketing the ancient terrain would have killed all the grass, forcing the abundance of grazing (grass-eating) animals to depart.  That’s a big drop in opportunities for obtaining meat from those animals.  So every landscape change affected the plants and animals – in fact, the entire ecosystem – and thus the early human toolmakers as well.Now consider this next image:White and gray layers reflect the gradual build-up of the Olorgesailie Formation layers. They indicate many shifts between lake and land from about 1.2 million to 490,000 years ago. The darker brown sediments are ancient river sediments.  The narrow brown bands across the present-day landscape represent the erosion of large river channels, which were eventually filled up with silt and sand of the younger Oltulelei Formation. A big question:  What caused the repeated cutting of river valleys, followed by silting up of those river and stream channels?After 490,000 years ago, the largest landscape changes we see were caused as river valleys were cut by erosion into the underlying Olorgesailie Formation.  These valleys were then filled up with brown silt and sand.  The filling was followed my more erosion as a new river valley formed.  This process happened at least 3 major times, and several minor times.The beautiful landscape of Olorgesailie – exposing layer after layer of landscape change, which could have resulted from climate shifts and earthquakes. Kay and I discussed two main causes:  Earthquakes or climate?  Earthquakes could have caused uplift of the Olorgesailie region, with rain and wind then carving out channels and creating valleys in the high ground of the uplifted landscape. The other possibility is climate.  That is, during dry times, the water levels across the region would have dropped, causing the occasional rain storm to carve the landscape down further and further over many years to reach the lower levels.  During wet times, as the regional water levels rose, the rivers and streams would have backed up and slowed, which caused the silt and sand in those flowing waters to be dumped within the channels.  In other words, cycles of erosion and deposition, over and over again as climate shifted over time.At present, Kay and I are pretty certain that these big fluctuations of the landscape in the younger geological beds reflect strong climate cycles – that is, big shifts between dry times and wet.The work continues as we keep seeking better clues to see whether we are right or not… The A Day at Olorgesailie, Kenya by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"128","I’m Director of Archaeology Scotland and have been in post here for nine years now. Day of Archaeology still takes me by surprise as I always intend to be more organised but never am! My approach to things is always a bit last minute as I have a lot of competing priorities keeping the organisation afloat.My team is now up to 13 staff working on a wide-range of projects and activities to help people engage more in archaeology in Scotland. Just now things are hotting up for this year’s Scottish Archaeology Month (SAM) which takes place each September. Lesley McEwan, our SAM coordinator had been planning a Big Dig in Edinburgh as part of SAM and we are working with AOC Archaeology supported by a wee HLF grant to make this happen and convince local people to try out a test pit in their gardens. Lots of media coverage about this this week including something in The Sun apparently! That’s a first for us.I was quite surprised by a couple of negative comments on the Scotsman online about the gardens dig. They were along the lines of “you’ll find nothing and why would people want to dig up their garden in the summer when they need it for the kids to play in”. I find it strange that archaeology can be seen in isolation from the benefits it can bring – learning new things, skills, meeting people, research and so on. Perhaps we need to be better at communicating that which is one reason why things like Day of Archaeology are so good!So far my day has been taken up with our response to the recently issued consultation on the new Historic Environment Strategy and merger of Historic Scotland and the Royal Commission in Scotland. Keeping an eye on and trying to influence policy and practice in Scotland is a large part of what we do and we work through our networks to try and have positive changes for the protection and appreciation of archaeology.This afternoon I’ve been sending some text and images to the developers of our new website which is an exciting event for us – to have a new site after many years of our existing one. The site should be live before the end of August (all being well).

"129","Last year, I put together a piece on the contents of my desk. It was appropriate at the time, as we had just completed a really big dig, and I was working at restoring order to my office work environment.This year, the big dig was (thankfully… it’s exhausting to manage) run by someone else, so I haven’t needed as much time to recuperate, though I’ve been no less busy. This Day of Archaeology post looks at my last week of work and how it covers a wide range of activities, all of which are within my duties as an archaeologist for the Arkansas Archeological Survey, the Natural State’s public and research archaeology agency. We’re one of the best (if not the best) such agencies in the country. My boss, Jamie Brandon, and I work at the Southern Arkansas University station, and handle archaeological research and outreach for 11 counties in southwest Arkansas (pretty much everything south of the Ouachita River, plus a few other counties thrown in to boot.Mapping BaytownThis was a rice field when Phillips, Ford, and Griffin visited. It’s a little harder to work in now.Though assigned to southwest Arkansas, I frequently get called out to assist with projects elsewhere around the state. Being the station assistant, I get calls to help Jamie’s equivalents in other stations quite frequently. The bulk of this week was just one such example.Dr. Elizabeth Horton, station archaeologist at Toltec Mounds State Park, focuses on furthering our understanding of the Toltec Mounds, located outside of Little Rock. To do this well, she needs to study contemporary sites to understand how Toltec fit into the social landscape of the time. In pursuit of that goal, she recently inaugurated a project focusing on the Baytown site in eastern Arkansas. Occupied during the same rough time period as Toltec (we believe this to be the case, but we need to make sure… that’s why we’re starting working there), Baytown was a set of mounds, perhaps as many as ten. It is also under threat from both looters (it’s on federal property, so anyone caught could get hit with an ARPA violation) and erosion, so this project is timely and necessary.Baytown is well-known in archaeological circles. It was one of the sites documented during the Lower Mississippi Valley Survey in the 1940s by Phillip Phillips, James A. Ford, and James B. Griffin. They named the Baytown phase after it, along with two pottery types, Baytown Plain and Baytown Incised. Check out their Archaeological Survey in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, 1940-1947 and Martha Rolingson’s chapters in The Woodland Southeast for more about the site. Despite its importance, Baytown hasn’t had that much research done on it. It’s been mapped a few times, and there have been some limited excavations, but nothing in line with what one would expect for such a site.To start fixing this shortfall, I helped Dr. Horton, Dr. John House (Survey station archaeologist at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff), Ms. Jessica Howe (station assistant at the University of Arkansas at Monticello) and two students start mapping the site and examining it for signs of disturbance, assessing threats to its integrity, and evaluating its potential for future work. Much of my responsibility circled around running the Trimble GeoXT global positioning system, which allowed us to map mounds and modern features, even in thick forest. This will allow us to register past sketch maps of the site to the modern landscape to assess landform change, document where previous work has taken place, and allow us to start planning future research.We really lucked out with field conditions, I must add. Usually, Arkansas in July is really, really hot. Eastern Arkansas also tends towards the humid side. Luckily, we ended up with a humid high-80s/low-90s with very few ticks or chiggers. The poison ivy was a little crazy, but with liberal application of Tecnu, I think we held that in check (knock on wood). It was, all-in-all, a really good time, though exhausting (as fieldwork usually is).Paperwork, Paperwork, PaperworkWorking within a statewide agency, there are forms to fill out and reports to file. I’ve got two travel claims to finish off this morning, and need to compile field notes and GIS data to send to Dr. Horton. But, being a researcher, I’ve got other, more engaging tasks to polish off.I’m in the process of editing a volume of chapters on Arkansas historical archaeology for publication. It’s a long, peer-reviewed process, and I’ve got some work to do on that this morning. I’m hoping that the project will be both a handy example of the effectiveness of the various state, federal, and private agencies on this front as well as an interesting volume for Arkansans, or anyone interested in historical archaeology and regional history to thumb through.Touring Dooley’s FerryGiving a Tour of Dooley’s Ferry, 2012Baytown was the research end of my job. The other end, public outreach, came on Friday afternoon. Each year, Historic Washington State Park (think Colonial Williamsburg, but for the 19th century) puts on the Red River Heritage Symposium, a multi-day teaching workshop and public lecture session focusing on the history and heritage of the Ark-La-Tex.In past years, I have given papers here on my research at Dooley’s Ferry and on the archaeology of Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield, a project I worked on while with the National Park Service. This year, I am giving a presentation on the archaeology of Dooley’s Ferry for the teaching workshop portion, showing a bit about what we have done, what we are going to do, and what archaeology can teach us about the past. I’ll probably throw in a bit about the Survey and how it functions in hopes of getting some opportunities to come and teach a bit about archaeology to regional schools.That’s supposed to be a tour of the site, but given today’s forecast…The Day of Archaeology 2013: From One End of the State to the Other by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"130","A picture is worth a thousand words the old adage goes. For historical archaeologists, photographs can provide important information about the location of buildings and activity areas. They can also provide insight into the everyday lives of past inhabitants. One of my current projects is the mapping and documentation of a World War II Italian Prisoner of War (PoW) camp in Monticello, Arkansas. Camp Monticello opened as a training facility for the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in 1943 and served as a Prisoner of War (PoW) camp for Italians from 1943 to 1946. Photographs of the camp provide important context for archaeological research, but as with any primary source they have to be examined carefully.Section of a map of the PoW Camp showing Compound 1.Camp Monticello consisted of three compounds that housed enlisted men, two compounds that held officers, a hospital and other facilities. The buildings of the camp have mostly disappeared from view. But the archaeological evidence of the PoW camp is relatively widespread and exhibits good preservation as concrete foundations mark the landscape. Archaeologists are increasingly interested in research on prisoner of war camps. Research in Europe, Canada, and the United States has fostered new understandings of PoW camps and their inmates. See for example, Michael Waters, Lone Star Stalag about a German PoW camp in Texas or Harold Mytum and Gilly Carr’s edited volume on prisoners of war. Archaeology at Camp Monticello has the potential to yield new information about the Arkansas’ role in World War II, the lives of women at the camp, and the ways in which the Italian PoWs adapted to confinement and expressed ethnic and cultural identity through daily practice.Gate to a compound at Camp Monticello. Photograph courtesy of the Drew County Historical MuseumI use historic photographs and documents to provide context. Photographs help me understand what the camp looked like, as well as how people may have used the space. But as with any source of information, I have to examine the photographs carefully. Photographs may appear to give an unmediated view of the past, a promise of truth and neutrality that is free of the partiality of written documents (Edwards and Hart 2004). However, this sensation is deceptive, because for each photograph the subject has been selected, framed, and thus partially constructed by the photographer. Plus, the photographs preserved in archival collections tend to have been taken for specific reasons. As Barbara Little points out, documentary history — photographs, deeds, wills, maps — offers us one set of evidence about the past. Archaeology offers us a different kind of evidence. Historical archaeology is a kind of scholarship that challenges our certainties in useful ways.A makeshift clothesline at Camp Monticello. Photo courtesy of the Drew County Historical Museum.Photographs are great sources for archaeological research, since archaeology provides a way to test and corroborate the information contained within the photographs. As we head into the field to map and test the site, we hope to find activity areas like the makeshift clothesline that show what everyday life was like for the PoWs at Camp Monticello.

"131","While it’s been a much slower season in terms of burials excavated this year, the quality of the finds thus far has been exceptional. One particular burial in Building 52 alone – still in the process of excavation – has already provided a number of very exciting discoveries. When the grave cut in the Northwest platform was opened several weeks ago we were confronted with what seemed a jumble of disarticulated juvenile skulls and and other loose bones. As the grave fill was gradually removed, however, we began to make sense of it all. The first intact body we came across belonged to an infant placed in the Northwest part of the grave cut. I’ve already reported on the well-preserved textiles found underneath this infant. Later, however, as we removed the last of the fabric we realized there was an older child lying directly beneath the infant. It seems the textile was placed between the two bodies but did not appear to wrap around either of them. This second child was also found with a wooden object – possibly a bowl – placed over its head. While Mellaart found a number of wooden household objects during his work at Çatal in the 1960′s, this is the first time such items have been found during the current excavations (this post continues here).The Making sense of an unusual multiple burial at Çatalhöyük by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"132","Probably the very first stage in most commercial archaeological investigations in the UK is in pre-planning when developers request an archaeological assessment (often known as a desk-based  assessment/DBA) to tell them what archaeology there might be on their site and what they might need to do about it. This is my job and it involves a lot of maps.I’m sure there’s a desk under there somewhere!!Today I was researching a site in Bloomsbury, looking for clues as to what archaeological remains might be on the site, and what archaeological remains might have been removed (because as interesting as 18th century quarry pits are the don’t leave much earlier stuff in place). The area I’m looking at has little evidence for prehistoric activity and was some distance from the Roman and Saxon settlements. During the medieval period it was part of the manor of ‘Blemundsbury’ (sound familiar?) named after the owner in the 13th century, William Blemund. The site is a little way from the medieval village of Lomsbury though so was probably farmland.We’re lucky in London to have maps going back to the 16th century easily accessible. The first one of these I usually look at is the Agas map of 1560. It has wonderful little details of people as well as buildings. Bloomsbury was pretty rural at this time.The Agas map. I like to think these dudes are having fun pretending to be birds (as aeroplanes hadn’t been invented!) During the Civil War defences were being built to defend towns, cities and other strategic points all over the county. London’s are pretty hard to pin down but on Rocque’s map of 1746 you can see the outline of one of the batteries which ran along the northern part of the defences in the gardens of Bedford House, just south of where Russell Square is today! It’s a little bit from my site though so not going to affect my history.Rocque’s map of 1746Moving into the 19th century we had a bit of a panic as I found a Baptist chapel lurking ominously near my site. This caused a flurry of overlaying and georeferencing to find out the exact relationship between my site and this chapel. Turns out it was outside the site so no need to fuss. Nonconformist chapels of the late 18th and early 19th century have a tendency to have burials under the floorboards and few, if any, records.Later 19th century development of the site looks relatively straight forward so I’m going to write up my report to say there is a high potential for post-medieval structural remains and associated features (i.e. foundations and wells!) but not much happening prior to that date except perhaps a bit of quarrying.So, time for another cuppa and then I’ll get on to assessing what this means when put into the context of what of the proposed development. This will involve looking in detail at the current buildings and how much archaeology their construction is likely to have involved and what might be left now.The Coralie Acheson (MOLA): Mapping the history of Bloomsbury by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I wish I could tell you that I was defiantly digging during a sandstorm in the ruins of Egypt. I wish I could tell you I was standing over a trench in a remote forest in Peru.

I’m based in Melbourne, Australia and while I’ve done a little bit of work overseas most of my career has been spent digging holes right here. This year I made the decision to go back to University and make my degree a little bit more impressive. I really want to emphasise the word little in that last sentence. So now I split my time between the office and on campus at the University of Melbourne. While I know this decision in the long term means that I will get to dig more holes in the future, it has severely cut down the amount of fieldwork I get to do which is super annoying. On the upside my car has never been cleaner, so there’s that.It also means that while the rain pours down outside I am cosy and warm, reading some big old dusty books and sneakily eating the bag of pretzels I have stashed in my bag so the librarians don’t catch me. There is however, no place like an archaeological site. The neatly dug trenches, the steel capped boots and the anticipation of finding something.

Few visitors cross the wall from the churchyard to visit them – the remains are difficult to ‘read’, having been robbed and rebuilt over two millennia. The church itself, built to one of Thomas Telford’s designs, stands testament to a period of violent change in the surrounding landscape, when many of the tenantry were forcibly removed. During 1845 a number of evicted families took shelter in the churchyard and etched their names in the beautiful windows providing a lasting memorial to an event that must have been truly traumatic for the people involved. Nowadays, the church is a serene and peaceful place to visit and a visitor noted that they were ‘moved to tears’ by the display. What place then, to help one think about social progress, inequality and change, not only in the 19th century (so recently in one sense), but also in the Iron Age when movements of people and power may have been every bit as dramatic.Aerial view looking along Strath Cuileamach with the church, manse and remains of the broch in the foreground, taken from the SE.

"137","Hello from the Research Assistant for the Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East. To save my time and yours, we just call it APAAME. We are perhaps best known for the Aerial Archaeology in Jordan Project which has conducted a season of aerial reconnaissance in Jordan from a helicopter every year since 1997. Day of Archaeology has not caught us in the air however, but in the office.I am writing this from our new office in New Barnett House on Little Clarendon St in Oxford. We are in the process of moving our entire archive to Oxford University from the University of Western Australia. Our large map collection is in mail tubes, and our complete collection of Hunting Aerial Survey diapositives of Jordan from 1953 are in 7 boxes against the wall, but the slides and printed photographs are unpacked – we just haven’t got shelving for them yet!Fortunately, the majority of our collection is already digitised, and that is what I will be working with for the most of today. Glamorous I know – but flying in a helicopter taking thousands of photographs of archaeological sites for a month a year, and delving through archives to investigate collections with aerial photographs of the Middle East, leaves quite a bit of follow up work.I have not even finished my first cup of coffee for the day and already I am fighting with Flickr. We use Flickr to host are on-line photographic database (www.flickr.com/apaame/collections). Flickr was chosen because it is relatively cheap and extremely accessible medium to host our ever-increasing archive. We have recently decided to upload our images with their full geo-referencing information, and so I am going through the backlog of updating around 61,000 images on Flickr with their geo-tags. I have to batch edit these photographs in Flickr, which is fine except the interface Flickr uses doesn’t seem to cope with handling too many images at once. *sigh* I’ll just get myself a cup of tea … Meanwhile, in the background, I have Adobe Light room where we catalogue all of our images updating the metadata in Flickr.Why am I geo-tagging our Flickr images? Traditionally, you would search for a location by place-name, but this is extremely difficult for the Middle East due to variations in place names and transliteration from Arabic to English, let alone to other languages such as French and German. (The Graeco-Roman city of Gerasa – for example, has appeared (so far) with 13 different spellings of its ancient and modern name in various languages). If you know where a place is located on a map however, you can simply go to the map interface (www.flickr.com/apaame/map) and zoom in on the area of interest, and you will see whether we have any geo-tagged photographs for that area and what site reference we are using. Alternatively, if you have found a site of particular interest on our archive but don’t know where it is, you can open the map interface and see its location on a map.While I am working over in one corner of our office tackling the everyday issues of managing a digital archive, Professor David Kennedy is in the other using the archive as part of his ongoing research. The digitisation of our archive has opened up an increasing amount of time that can be dedicated to analysis and research, and has meant an increasing output of publications. Currently David is researching the Hinterland of Roman Philadelphia, which involves the search for historical photography, maps and early explorers accounts of a landscape that is now largely built over. He is putting the final touches to a lecture inspired by this ongoing research that will be delivered at the ARAM conference on ‘The Decapolis’ at Oxford University’s Oriental Institute on Monday: ‘Brünnow and von Domaszewski in the Jordanian Decapolis’. The research for this lecture involved time spent in Princeton earlier this year where the photographic archive of Brünnow and von Domaszewski is held.Now that I seem to have Flickr happily batch organising my geo-tagged items to be accessible to anyone, I am doing a bit of research on Content Management Systems and digital archaeology projects. APAAME is looking to evolve the way in which we manage our content and related data, but exactly what system we implement for what purpose is currently under investigation. Everyone has their areas of expertise, and so we are contacting those that have computer database, data mining and CMS operating know-how that might have some good advice for us. I am also keeping an eye on our twitter feed, that is particularly active today with everyone’s #dayofarch posts, as well as updating our blog with info about our new publication.So that is what APAAME were up to on this day, 26 July 2013.If you would like to contact us or keep in touch– please feel free to use one of the following methodsAPAAME-classics@uwa.edu.auTwitter: @APAAMEBlog: http://www.apaame.orgFlickr archive: www.flickr.com/apaame/collectionsThe A Day on the Ground for an Aerial Archaeology Project by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"138","Glasgow. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’I’m Martin Conlon, Education Trainee at RCAHMS. The archaeological site that I’ve chosen to write about is that of the Govan Iron Works in Glasgow. The site is one of many surveyed as a result of the construction of the extension to the M74.  The extension passed over a dense locality of hidden industrial gems, each site a memory of our relatively recent past. With the large- scale of the motorway development, it was important that archaeologists took advantage of the opportunities to survey and record key areas prior to them being potentially lost. It was also crucial that no archaeological remains were damaged or removed without proper records being made.Digital image of watercolour dating from 1899, inscribed “Dixon’s Ironworks”. Copyright RCAHMS (DP009088)     The excavations by HAPCA (a joint venture between Headland Archaeology Ltd and Pro-Construct Archaeology) uncovered the foundations of the old premises of Caledonian Pottery in Rutherglen, established around 1800 and closing in the mid 1870s, including remains of kilns (ovens used to dry and harden pottery). Also unearthed were signs of the massive urban development that took place in the area several hundred years ago, with the foundations of early tenements found just off Pollokshaws Road, amongst a dense network of remains of 19th century tenements, pubs, churches and shops.Located on Cathcart Road, the Iron Works was the first of its scale to spring up in Glasgow, founded in 1837 by William Dixon.The Iron Works was known as ‘Dixon’s Blazes’ for the propensity of the blast furnaces to illuminate Glasgow’s smoggy industrial skyline. Drawn by William Simpson in the late 1890s, the illustration above shows the Iron Works from the South, with a row of single-storey houses in front known as ‘Collier’s Raw’. The last working blast furnace ceased operation in 1958 and the site has since been re-developed.Martin looking through the collection. Copyright RCAHMSAround 15 boxes of photographs, drawings and notes of the M74 project have now reached RCAHMS where they have been catalogued and housed as part of our collections. Using other material held at RCAHMS, like the RAF National Survey (Air Photographs 1944-1950) image below, the site’s history can be very clearly understood. The M74 collection is an important reminder of the importance of post-medieval archaeology and the idea that archaeological investigation is not strictly confined to our ancient history. RAF National Survey (Air Photographs), 1944-1950 Scanned Image of RAF oblique aerial view showing part of the Hutchestown district with the Govan Ironworks (Dixon’s Blazes) Copyright RCAHMS (SC1024381)This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Martin Conlon (RCAHMS) – Glasgow by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"141","Fife ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Falkland PalaceOver the last three months I have been researching the history of Falkland Palace, situated in Fife while on placement there as a Skills for the Future education trainee. It is surrounded by a wealth of history, not only from the surrounding village of Falkland but also in the very grounds of the palace. Under the Palace garden, remains of earlier structures have been found and others have completely vanished.View of Falkland Palace. Copyright Aisha Al-Sadie  The earliest known structure on the site was a 12th century hunting lodge owned by the Clan McDuff, the Earls of Fife. It is not known whether the lodge was either destroyed or whether it was incorporated into the later Falkland Castle which was levelled in 1371.The 3rd Marquess of Bute who was the Keeper of the Palace in the 1800s carried out several archaeological digs to look for evidence of the medieval site of Falkland Castle but only found a pile of medieval rubble. However, foundations of a 14th century Well Tower and the Palace’s destroyed North Range were discovered at this time which are thought to be either part of a Great Hall or a Chapel. The Marquess placed stones over these foundations to enhance the structures of both these sites and reformed the ‘upper garden’ to express the shape of the ruined buildings. Medieval remains of the castle were also found buried in the 17th century bowling green which the Marquess removed when digging, the rest of the stone was probably reused to build Falkland Palace in the 1500s.Copyright Aisha Al-SadieIn the 17th century Sir David Murray and his brother built a mansion house in the northern part of the Palace garden. This has been referred to as the Low Palace, the Castlestead, the Rangers House and the Netherplace of Falkland. During this period the Palace lay empty and fell into ruin so by 1757 no effort had been made to repair it.Drawing, by the author, of Falkland Palace. Copyright Aisha Al-Sadie“in my last that I was at Falkland which I found in very ill cause both as to the glasses and window cases and floorings, and besides it will be very inconvenient and chargeable living there since I have no interest in it, nor near it so that I think any charges I will be at will be better bestowed at Huntingtower…” Lord Murray writing to his father-in-law the Duke of Hamilton on Falkland Palace, 1684Ironically, the structures built during this period no longer exist and little is known about them. However the 3rd Marquess of Bute ensured that Falkland Palace itself was preserved for future generations. Unfortunately he died in 1900 before he could complete all his plans for the palace. One of these was to put a roof over the ruined East Range which is still a shell, it is however constantly monitored and conserved by the Deputy Keeper, National Trust for Scotland and partly funded by Historic Scotland through the Annual Maintenance Grant Scheme.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.For further information you can also contact the local authority archaeologist.

"142","Borders ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Rebecca Jones, Historic ScotlandCarry on Camping in the Scottish BordersI’m Rebecca Jones and I used to work at RCAHMS but since August 2012 have been on secondment to Historic Scotland where I am now Head of Archaeology Strategy.I have picked what appear to be a series of empty fields in the Scottish Borders, not far from Lauder on a hill above the Leader Water. These unassuming fields, now home to various sheep and crops, once held an army of around 40,000 Roman soldiers and probably the Emperor Septimius Severus and his entourage campaigning in Scotland in the early 3rd century AD with the specific aim of completing the conquest of Britannia (he did not succeed…).All that we can see now at St Leonards is the differential growth of crops over the buried features (‘cropmarks’), best recorded through aerial photography.North-east side of camp and one of its entrances, together with a settlement and enclosure which intersect the camp’s perimeter. Copyright RCAHMS (SC882008)We can recognise these linear cropmarks as being of Roman origin due to their characteristics: rounded corners, entrance gaps protected by additional stretches of ditch. In the case of St Leonards, this camp site lies close to the Dere Street Roman road, midway between two probably similar sized camps at Newstead (near Melrose) and Channelkirk (near Oxton). At 173 acres / 70 hectares, it is the largest camp recorded in the Roman Empire in Europe. Larger camps have recently been discovered in Syria: these may not have held a larger number of troops than St Leonards but perhaps needed a buffer within the perimeter to counter the threat of hostile Syrian archers.Plan of St Leonards. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Archaeology has a challenge when it comes to enthusing people about buried remains that they cannot see, particularly if there is no excavation in progress to show the depth of the ditches dug around the perimeter of the campsite, the fragmentary remains of ovens where they baked their meals and the rubbish and latrine pits where they disposed of… well, anything needing disposal! Yet we can fire imaginations by inviting our audiences to conjure up images of rows upon rows of tents housing soldiers who originated from around the Empire and spoke a variety of languages, not just Latin. The Emperor Septimius himself was from Libya in Northern Africa. We don’t know for definite that Septimius was here – we have no dating evidence from the site – but the most likely context for such a huge camp is the presence of the Emperor and his bodyguards and administration. I certainly love the idea that, for a few days and nights at least, the whole of the Roman Empire was run from these fields in the Borders.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Rebecca Jones (Historic Scotland) – Scottish Borders by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"143","The TVC is careful to consider past valuations when arriving at new ones, so comparison folders come in handyTalking about the financial value of Archaeology and archaeological objects is something that many heritage professionals shy away from, and the ‘value’ of heritage (in a wider sense) is the subject of on-going debates (for example, see ‘Can you put a price on culture?’ in the July/August 2013 instalment of the Museums Journal). But value is something that I deal with every day in my job. As the Treasure Registrar in the British Museum’s Department of Portable Antiquities & Treasure, I am responsible for compiling the minutes of the meetings of the Treasure Valuation Committee (TVC), and this particular task is what is facing me on the Day of Archaeology 2013.The TVC is, in official parlance, a Non Departmental Government Body (in non-official parlance, a Quango) whose role it is to recommend to the Secretary of State the value of Treasure finds that come before it. This value is then used to pay a reward to the finder of a Treasure cases and the owner of the land where it was found. In cases where an interested party has acted improperly, the TVC also advises on the abatement of rewards. It is made up of a group of independent experts with knowledge of certain artefact types and other expertise and coming from a variety of backgrounds; current membership of the Committee, which is chaired by Lord Renfrew, can be seen here.Fairness and equality are the underlying principles of the TVC’s existence and its work. The Treasure Act 1996 obliges finders of potential Treasure to report their finds to the coroner, and if the finds meet the criteria for Treasure, then the law says those finds belong to the Crown and they can be placed in an appropriate museum, with a reward equal to the market value of the find being paid to the finder and landowner. The effective working of the Act depends on finders coming forward and reporting their finds, and they will only do so as long as they feel they are being treated fairly by the law.That is where the TVC comes into the picture. Its members fastidiously apply the Committee’s terms of reference (spelled out in paragraph 65 of the Treasure Act Code of Practice) and go to great length to arrive at mutual decisions as to the value of the finds which come before them.The term ‘value’ is complex and prone to misunderstanding. What the Committee is tasked to do is to arrive at a recommended value equal to what might be paid for a find in a sale on the open market between a willing seller and willing buyer. The Committee recently adopted a memo explaining that it understands this scenario to be equivalent to a theoretical auction ‘hammer price’ – so in other words, the Committee endeavours to determine what a find might fetch at auction. This is different than a retail price set on goods in a shop, because the retail price incorporates a mark-up applied by the merchant to cover expenses and to bring a profit. Therefore the Committee usually finds it more straightforward to look at similar examples which have gone to public auction.Discussion of an object’s value always begin with a report provided for the TVC by an independent ‘provisional valuer’, someone in the antiquities trade, external to the Committee, who has studied the object and done an assessment of it worth. This is also shared with the interested parties in a case – the finder, landowner and acquiring museum – who can supply their own comments on the provisional valuation or commission a valuation of their own.What is clear, in my experience of working with the TVC, is that it is absolutely focussed on calculating an accurate ‘hammer price’ for these finds. It doesn’t allow itself to be influenced by whether or not a museum (who is responsible for paying the reward) will be able to afford a recommended value. Similarly, it doesn’t ‘take sympathy’ on a finder and inflate a price in order not to appear mean. The TVC makes its determination based simply on experience and evidence.But it doesn’t stop there – in a further effort to demonstrate fairness, the TVC’s recommendation is circulated to all of the interested parties in a case, and they are invited to submit a ‘challenge’ to the valuation if they disagree, and the TVC will reconsider the case and take account of any new information or evidence that the interested parties provide.It is these recommendations of the TVC which has me occupied today. We feel it is desirable (especially with higher valued finds) to provide interested parties with some of the rationale behind the Committee’s decisions, rather than just passing on a value. Therefore the minutes of the TVC meetings can grow into rather large documents! Minutes of past meetings, where all of the cases have been closed, are available for viewing on the website of the Portable Antiquities Scheme, here.So the entire process is engineered to ensure that interested parties can see that the Committee is acting on the best information it has available, that its decisions are objective and that it is willing to take account of their evidence. The consequence of this is that it can take some time for valuations to be agreed, rewards to be paid, and cases closed, but that seems an acceptable sacrifice to ensure due diligence, fairness and transparency. If this in turn contributes to finders reporting potential Treasure and the important discoveries ending up in museums, we’ll feel like we’ve performed a service to the heritage of this country. Just don’t ask me how to value that…The Valuing Archaeological Finds by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I’ve been interested in archaeology since I was at primary school, and went on my first dig in 1969. I was hooked, and spent all my school holidays going on digs in Britain and abroad, before going studying archaeology at university. As well as working in field archaeology (digging) I also spent almost 20 years in archaeological conservation and management with the National Trust for Scotland (NTS).One of the best things I’ve ever been involved in was at the small Scottish town of Bo’ness, on the south side of the River Forth. It used to be a thriving industrial town but became increasingly down at heel in the later 20th century. As part of the NTS Little Houses  Improvement Scheme, we transformed Dymock’s Buildings –a derelict group of ugly-looking buildings –into something that the town could once again be proud of, and I was responsible for ensuring that a detailed archaeological record was made of the standing buildings and also of what was under them.Dymocks N Street facade before Copyright Robin TurnerDymocks N Street facade after Copyright Robin Turner        As well as unravelling the very complex story of the buildings, from their origins on reclaimed land in the 1650s to their 20th-century uses, we excavated beneath them and found the remains of an amazing salt pan: in the 1600s the south side of the Forth was a centre for heating seawater and making salt. The buildings are now in community use, but there is occasional public access where local people and visitors can find out about the story of the buildings. But the best bit is what our work did for the community. The buildings were transformed from being an eyesore to being something that people could admire and be proud of. The community went on to renovate the Hippodrome - one of the earliest picture houses in Britain. In part because of these initiatives, the community’s civic pride has been greatly enhanced.Archaeology is not about things: it’s about people: people in the past, but people in the present too, and in the future. Through their work, archaeologists can change people’s lives.Dymock’s Building: NTS Booklet cover.

Means, Director of the Virtual Curation Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth UniversityExcavating at Ferry Farm.Just over a year ago, on the last Day of Archaeology, I found myself at George Washington’s Ferry Farm in Fredericksburg, Virginia, focused on using a laser scanner to create 3D digital models of artifacts recovered from this site.  Today, I find myself again at Ferry Farm, this time on the last day of the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) archaeological field school that I am teaching in cooperation with the George Washington Foundation (GWF). GWF archaeologist Laura Galke is director of the field effort, and her assistant field director is Eric Larsen.Ferry Farm field director Laura Galke holding a recent find.Eric Larsen helps map the current excavations. My direct field assistant to the VCU field school for this effort is Ashley McCuistion, a GWF intern, current VCU student, and a legacy of the VCU field school.  Ashley was a field student here herself last year, and blogged about her time at Ferry Farm for the 2012 Day of Archaeology.Ashley McCuistion is shovel ready.Ferry Farm is the location where George Washington grew from boy to man, and GWF archaeologists have been working for years to explore this archaeological landscape.  Nothing remains standing of the Washington-era structures, nor the extensive American Civil War encampment that was located here—directly overlapping the buried remains of the Washington house itself in some places. The history of human occupation in this area stretches back millennia, with evidence of American Indian use of the Ferry Farm landscape going back at least 10,000 years.George Washington, third from left, stands with three of the field school students.This year, VCU and GWF archaeologists are working to explore the backyard associated with the Washington-era home.  This was a working yard in part, with one of the activities reflected being the maintenance of wigs.  Ferry Farm has over 160 wig hair curlers—a large number from a domestic site—and these were associated with maintaining wigs for George Washington’s younger brothers.  The fashionable gentleman of the late 18th century wore a wig—the single most expensive part of the gentry-class man’s wardrobe.  Traces of a formal garden behind the house have been found as well.The end of a wig hair curler found on July 4, 2013.Today is a bittersweet day for the VCU field school, as it is our last day.  The field school students will work on their unit profiles, fill out their unit summary forms, take a quiz on identifying ceramic types, and discuss readings about challenges in interpreting the past.  Most of the students I will see in a few short weeks, as they are either taking additional classes from me, and/or interning in the Virtual Curation Laboratory that I direct.  The archaeology bug has bitten these students, and soon they will be unleashed upon the world.  Rather than reflect on my experiences as their instructor for this field school, I’ll present here their impressions of their favorite thing about field school or what field school has meant to them, which they provided to me yesterday in written form:Francesca Chesler : “My favorite thing about field school was finding a wig curler! This was my number one goal in field school, and finding one really boosted my confidence not only in myself, but in my abilities as an archaeologist.  In addition to this, I enjoyed the screening process because it gave me a chance to scrutinize the dirt excavated and look for additional artifacts which may have been missed while digging the dirt in the unit up originally.”Francesca Chesler finds a wig hair curler.Aaron Ellrich: “My favorite thing is the camaraderie found in the field. Like the saying goes, “There is no ‘I’ in team.”—which is what I found out on the first day. . It is a team effort…. and communication is essential for not only understanding what is going on at the site, but, a time to get to know others interested in the field—you never know, you may be working with them (or they may even get you a job) in the future! Second to this, our field trips went hand-in-hand with this topic and enhanced my experience!”Aaron Ellrich holding a 8,000 year-old American Indian stone tool.Vivian Hite: “I think that with field school there wasn’t an exact moment or practice that I enjoyed most but what I got from the field school.  I took field school so that I could better determine if I wanted to pursue a career in archaeology.  The reason I love archaeology is because I’m constantly learning something new.  Whether it’s a new way to do something, a new technique or skill, a strange artifact, an unidentified feature, or just compiling the knowledge learned and applying to a more generalized question; it’s a constant cycle.  The flow of information from one person to another about artifacts, features, and sites is amazing to be a part of. That’s my favorite thing about field school. “Vivian Hite, pointing, interacts with a visitor on July 4, 2013.Stephanie King: “I consider field school to be the final step to becoming a legitimate archaeologist. The lessons learned here provide students with the necessary knowledge to execute archaeological processes on a basic level, and those who are flexible will adapt to the needs of related occupations. In short, I feel that field school is paramount to employment in any archaeological field.”Stephanie King begins excavating a new test unit.Ruth Martin: “The part of field school that means the most to me is all of the experience I am gaining.  Learning things outside the class room and applying things you learned in class has been a great experience for me.”Ruth Martin works in the lab.Olivia McCarty: “What I have enjoyed the most about field school is what a sense of accomplishment you feel throughout the day. It can stem from the fact that you just found a special artifact, someone in your group finding an interesting feature (this of course doesn’t include the 20th century trench), the fact that you and your partner have managed to keep your unit even as you’ve scrapped away at your layer, or when you finally begin to pick up the subtle changes in soil that at the start of the school you couldn’t see at all. All these things have validated to me that field school had been an amazing experience and made me hungry for more fieldwork opportunities.”Olivia McCarty removes soil from her unit.Linda Polk: “My favorite thing about field school had to be finding artifacts and trying to interpret what they were. To me, it was like a big game of Clue with ceramics, nails, glass, and all the other types of artifacts found at Ferry Farm.”Linda Polk finds a wig hair curler.Lauren Volkers: “This whole field school experience is my favorite thing about field school, because it has helped me gained the skills and knowledge I need for future archaeological dig sites. I also enjoyed my entire time here at Ferry Farm and all of the people I met along the way. I had such a great time that choosing one aspect is just too hard of a task.”Lauren Volkers compares a sleave button she found with a replica from a Civil War soldier reenactor on July 4, 2013.Mariana: “I cannot express in words how much I value my experience at Ferry Farm. Field school was a chance to gain the knowledge and skills needed in order to become a successful archaeologist. More than that, it was a chance to connect with peers with similar interests and professionals from all over Virginia. Field school has been an amazing experience that has given me the confidence to move forward and one that has equipped me with an understanding of what it means to be an archaeologist.”Mariana Zechini’s finding of a wig hair curler attracts some attention.Ashley McCuistion, far right, instructs the VCU field school students on their first day.I can add that I look forward to working with these burgeoning professionals in the future, and seeing what exciting research they are doing—and about which they will be posting in a future Day of Archaeology blog!!!!!

"146","The conservatin of Pitt Rivers archaeological models from 1890′sPart 4Watch our conservation video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1UpsOW5ecAn Aim Pilgrim Trust Conservation ProjectThis year, Salisbury Museum was awarded a grant from the AIM Pilgrim Trust Conservation Scheme to conserve the models. As these four models are so heavy and fragile, the Wiltshire Conservation Service moved some of its equipment to create an conservation laboatory at the museum and opened the doors to the public.At many museums there is only ever enough space to display a small proportion of the collection at any one time. These models are very large and although they provide a significant resource, they do take up a good deal of space within a gallery. To make the most of the gallery space, smaller examples of Pitt Rivers’ models have been on display.  By conserving these large models today, the Conservation Service will ensure that they will be protected and remain in good condition for the future.The Pitt Rivers excavation modelsThe four Pitt Rivers models depict excavations at Cranborne ChaseRotherley: a Romano-British settlement excavated by Pitt Rivers in 1886-7The model of Rotherley is made of solid wood, whereas the other three are made of plaster of Paris supported by a wire frame. The largest model, the Woodyates hypocaust measures over a metre long and takes 6 people to lift!Wansdyke: a bank and ditch earthwork probably dating to the C5th AD, excavated in 1889•Woodyates Hypocaust: part of a Roman settlement, 1889-90Bokerley Dyke a bank and ditch earthwork possibly of late Roman date, excavated in 1890Condition of the modelsThe 3-dimensional model of Bokerley Dyke, for example consists of a wooden frame filled with plaster which has been painted to show details of the site and its contours. The model is dirty and dusty, with heavy deposits over much of the surface and cobwebs evident in some areas.Dirt and dust has built up on the objects over time and in some cases, this has changed the colour of the models and stained other areas.The wooden structure of the models has split and cracked in many areas. Wood shrinks and expands, reacting to the levels of humidity in the atmosphere. As the wood expands, this can force it to break and split giving it an uneven, damaged surface.Where other materials, such as paint or plaster are attached to the wood, the uneven surface puts a strain on the paint; stretching or crushing it until the paint or plaster cracks and breaks off. Some fragments of paint or plaster have fallen off and been lost.Three of the models have been attacked by woodworm. These are insect larvae, which eat their way through the wood and form complex tunnel systems inside the structure. Woodworm thrive in damp environments. If left untreated, the infested wood can be so badly damaged that it will crumble away completely.Why is conservation necessary?Our conservation treatment will help to make sure that the models survive so that future generations can see them. Without conservation treatment, the models would continue to deteriorate. The woodworm infestation would weaken the wooden frames to the point where they could collapse. The chips and paint loss mean significant details are lost. The surface dirt, dust and stains make the models harder to understand and appreciate for their craftsmanship and information.Treatment Proposal:Clean the wood and painted plaster to remove dust, dirt and stainingConsolidate areas of flaking paintAdhere the separated fragments of plaster and paintFill areas of missing plaster where necessary for structural stabilityTreat the woodworm infestation to prevent further structural damageConservation treatmentAll solvents, adhesives and techniques were rigorously tested in the laboratories before treatment commenced to ensure that no ill effects would occur to the models. Solubility tests were carried out on paint samples and the suitability of each adhesive in terms of bond strength, appearance and penetration were assessed.Stable areas of the surface were dry cleaned first with a museum vac and soft brushes to removes loose dirt and debris.The stable surface areas were then cleaned with smoke sponge (vulcanised natural rubber) to remove more ingrained deposits of dirt and dust. Any smoke sponge debris was removed with a museum vac and soft brush.   Model – partially cleaned  Fragile flaking areas of paint were consolidated with an acrylic solution with distilled water.Areas of exposed plaster were stabilised using a facing of Japanese tissue adhered with acrylic adhesive. Areas of unsupported plaster have been stabilised by filling underlying gaps using Japanese tissue and injecting a acrylic solution with distilled water.Areas affected by woodworm infestation where cleaned with a museum vac and soft brush to remove any loose frass from the infestation. These areas where then sprayed with a water-based insecticide.Why aren’t the models going on display?Made-to-measure storage crates are being constructed for the models so that they are protected from the environment and pests which will prevent any further damage happening to them in the future. The bespoke crates will make it much easier to manoeuvre the models around the museum, without causing further damage.For more information:Visit our website: http://www.wshc.eu/our-services/conservation.htmlOr contact us: conservationartifacts@wiltshire.gov.uk  Tel. 01279 705500The The conservation of Pitt Rivers archaeological models by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"147","I have a fairly standard background in archaeology (a degree from Cambridge, a PhD from UCL) and have worked both as a museum curator and as a university lecturer. I am also the author of several archaeological books (details can be found on my website), but I currently combine teaching for The Open University with writing historical fiction. My novels are directly inspired by archaeology. My first novel, Undreamed Shores (set in the Early Bronze Age) draws strongly on my own archaeological research carried out in the Channel Islands and elsewhere from 1981 to 1995. My second, An Accidental King (set in the 1st Century AD) is based on published archaeological discoveries at Fishbourne, London, Colchester and Thetford. My third, on which I am currently working, will revisit some of my own discoveries (specifically my excavations at La Hougue Bie, Jersey). For every day that I spend actually writing, I’d say that I spend at least two days researching (often at the British Library, or at the National Archives in Kew, but also visiting museums and the places I plan to write about) and three days editing (today is an editing day). Some of my characters are historical, and some are simply made up (it is fiction, after all), but some are based directly on archaeological discoveries (I have posted a specific example of this on my blog). My move from writing archaeological (and biographical) non-fiction to writing novels inspired by archaeology and history was prompted by a desire to transcend the inevitable limitations of the archaeological record in getting closer to the people of the past, to envisage them as real people with names, passions, hopes and desires, but I try to base my fiction quite closely on the archaeology and the history, writing nothing implausible, and frequently allowing the archaeological record itself to suggest a storyline.The Archaeology and Historical Fiction: Creating Characters from Dust by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"148","Working as Curator of Archaeology at Manchester Museum is never short of variety. I am currently working on a temporary exhibition about figurines from Koma Land in Ghana in West Africa that opens October 25 2013. This will be the first time that such figurines, which date roughly from the same time as our Middle Ages, have been shown outside Ghana with the approval of the Ghanaian authorities. It has been quite a learning curve and it’s been a great privilege to work with Prof Tim Insoll of the University of Manchester and Dr Benjamin Kankpeyeng of the University of Ghana to find out about what these beautiful but enigmatic figurines mean. Today I am editing some text for the exhibition. Shaving off words in order to reduce the number for the designer is challenging as a few words can subtly change the meaning about figurines that are already loaded with significance and complexity.Working at the Museum means that I come across some great objects during my day to day activity. Yesterday I was just about to take a seat at the staff presentation when Lindsey Loughtman, one of the Assistant Curators  called me over to say she’d found an object in the Botany collection that appeared to be archaeology. I recognised it immediately as a neolithic ground and polished stone axehead dating from about 3500-2000 BC. Not only that, it had the original ‘O’ number museum reference written on it together with the name of the place where it was found: Winton near Eccles. It was a stone axehead I knew of from references in J.Wilfrid Jackson’s papers about the archaeology of Manchester. Jackson was the very widely respected curator who worked at Manchester Museum during the first half of the 20th century. The Eccles axehead is listed in Jackson’s ‘The Prehistoric Archaeology of Lancashire and Cheshire’, Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society 50 (1936), pp.65-106; and in his ‘Contributions to the Archaeology of the Manchester Region’, The North Western Naturalist 11 (1936), pp.110-119.The axehead turned up during the building of the new Westwood housing estate at Winton in 1922. At the time it was described as one of the finest and most perfect specimens in the Manchester area. J.J.Phelps in a short article ‘Stone Implement found at Winton, Eccles’, Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society 40 (19XX), pp.42-44 described it as ‘a remarkably fine specimen’ and ‘one of the finest and most perfect specimens found in the district around Manchester’.Wilton Axe c. Bryan Sitch The axehead was found in June 1922 by Mr. James Caine, who saw it lying on top of spoil thrown out of a drainage trench cut in the soil about the centre of a newly made roadway named Westwood Crescent near Parrin Lane. The axehead has been sampled petrologically. You can see the thin slot cut in the side of the axe in order to provide a thin section to be used for identification. The stone was identified by J.W.Jackson of Manchester Museum as group VI greenstone, a kind of rock known as volcanic tuff. It is fine grained because it is made up of the compacted dust and grains from volcanic eruptions millions of years ago. It shares characteristics with glass and flint which means it can be shaped by flaking because it will break in a predictable way. The source material outcrops in Langdale in the Lake District and the Pike O’Stickle quarry is famous for its breath-taking location. The prehistoric axe-makers made rough-outs and then ground and polished the rough-out until it was smooth and of a regular, symmetrical shape. I wanted to display it with other Manchester neolithic discoveries in our new Ancient Worlds displays which opened last autumn but unfortunately I couldn’t locate it at that time. And to think it was in the Botany department all the time!So all-in-all a wonderful surprise and great to be reunited with an old friend.Written by Bryan Sitch, Deputy Head of Collections and Curator of Archaeology at Manchester Museum.Follow @BryanSitchThe Surprise find @ Manchester Museum by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"149","I hold a hybrid job role within MOLA, being both an Archivist and a Senior Archaeologist for watching briefs. Combined, these provide me with a variety of different tasks and settings in which to spend my working days.Within the MOLA Archive team I am principally responsible for preparing all the finds and finds records from sites, in readiness for their deposition into the relevant accepting public repository. Much of the material I handle relates to excavations from within Greater London and therefore is ultimately to be deposited into The London Archaeological Archive and Resource Centre (LAARC) run by The Museum of London, which has its own standards to which the prepared material must conform.Phil in Archive-mode, checking finds data tablesWhilst having several small – medium sized finds projects currently on the go, I am also overseeing a long term finds archive project which has been opened up for the public to get involved with. This volunteering opportunity is concerned with preparing all the finds material from the excavation of the Guildhall Yard in the City of London during 1992-1997 (Site Code GYE92).GYE92 is perhaps the largest finds archive to be prepared by MOLA and also one of the largest ever to be received (eventually) by LAARC. To give you an idea of the scale of the project, there are some 2339 boxes of finds/environmental remains stored on 157 shelves across three bays of the building we occupy, plus larger objects yet to be discovered off site. There are over 20,500 Accessioned Finds, some of which are on display in the Guildhall and others already noted as missing in action. In order that the material is archive worthy, the finds must be packaged and labelled according to LAARC’s standards and these must then run in numerical sequence within boxes of material type. The boxes are then stored in material and numerical sequence on the shelves. All the finds must be checked against and systematically logged onto the finds or environmental inventory spreadsheets which have an initial combined cell count of over half a million cells. Where appropriate, errors, omissions, additions and amendments noted must also be updated on MOLA’s primary Oracle database and a running Archivist’s Note of un-resolvable errors/omissions kept to accompany the final archive deposit.We currently have a pool of 6 members of the public volunteering on the project two days per week and for the last few months they have been processing the bulk animal bone from the site, (all 924 boxes of it)! Typically the volunteers can come in and once settled, get on with the day’s tasks with minimal direction, however I’m on call to assist with queries as and when they arise. This might be concerned with relocating non-bone material that has incorrectly made its way into the animal bone boxes or resolving discrepancies with context numbering or packaging policies. The information that the volunteers collate is then updated onto the final Excel finds inventory which is growing by the day as new discoveries not captured on the original database are brought to light during re-packaging.Whilst not preparing finds or chasing up their present whereabouts in a building the size of an aircraft hanger or overseeing the volunteers, I might well be involved with other archive duties such as checking field records or converting digital files into archive storable versions. Alternatively, I may be dealing with one of the fieldwork watching brief projects I have been assigned to look after in the capacity of a Senior Archaeologist within the Field Team. Two of these projects are what can be described as long term and intermittent in nature and involve me monitoring certain key ground works on infrastructure projects that span several years. A watching brief is usually undertaken on sites where the proposed construction works do not require an archaeological excavation to be conducted or follow on from earlier evaluation trenching or archaeological excavations close by and are usually undertaken by one attendant experienced Field archaeologist.Phil with his Archaeologist Hat on now (c) MOLA 2013The job essentially requires a high degree of observation under less than ideal circumstances, where a few minutes may be all the time permitted to make quick records of archaeological features and natural strata as they are removed by the machines at work. My projects require me to remotely monitor complex construction schedules via phone and email with lead engineers on the sites and organise myself to be on site when the latest sequence of excavations for new foundations, utility trenches, shafts or general ground reduction is due to begin. The sites I visit are varied and fall in numerous London boroughs, from public spaces such as the streets of The West End and central London parks to industrial sites of former power stations or basements of residential and commercial properties. Generally, schedules rarely stay on track and an anticipated site visit might be put back on the proposed day as problems arise with anything from a break down of a machine to discovery of asbestos or particularly reinforced concrete. In this case I have to be pretty flexible with my diary and be accommodating to working on several separate pieces of indoor archive work which will ultimately be interrupted. As well as actually creating the primary field records during my on site monitoring, I am also responsible for producing reports based on these observations, this brings me into contact with several other departments such as the Drawing Office, Photography Studio and Geomatics/Survey team.

In my twenty-nine years as photographer with the RCAHMS, I have had the good fortune to travel the country and photograph both architecture and archaeology from the air and on the ground.Not being an archaeologist hasn’t prevented me from appreciating, learning and understanding the basics of the subject. However, like many other non archaeologists, I always thought that archaeology was found in the hinterlands of any country. From the farm land fields of Scotland, of which I have photographed many a crop mark site to the highland clearance areas through to an Indiana Jones type of site set in the deserts.However, I found that you do not need to travel further than your front door to encounter an archaeological site. I live in the south side of Edinburgh and found only recently the Caiystane near Oxgangs Road, a standing stone with weathered cup markings. Nothing particularly outstanding, and one of many in the area.Drawing showing view of six standing stones and wayside crosses. No.1 the Caiy Stane. Copyright RCAHMS (DP050277) There are several suggestions as to the origin and purpose of the stone. The stone may have been erected in the Neolithic period and marks a burial. Others suggest it commemorates the site of a battle between the Picts and the Romans.General view of the Caiystane. Copyright RCAHMS (DP092799)   It’s a fairly featureless piece of stone and not what you’d call attractive, but it’s where it’s sited that makes it fascinating: smack dab in the middle of a housing estate. It is a site with an interesting and unknown history; nestled somewhat inconspicuously within the estate that many people must pass in a day not giving it a second look.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Robert Adam (RCAHMS) – Edinburgh by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"151","AOC Archaeology Group has been working with Culver Archaeological Project (CAP) on their excavation of a newly discovered Roman site at Bridge Farm near Barcombe, East Sussex. This post is a joint post from AOC and CAP!Just part of the brilliant CAP 2013 team: members of CAP, Cat and Chris of AOC, and of course many wonderful volunteers (the team changes every day – sorry to those not in this photo!)CAP began in 2005 with a simple programme of field-walking, survey and trial trenching in the hope of identifying further archaeological sites in the landscape around Barcombe Villa. Fieldwalking finds included Roman pottery and coins dating to the 1st and 5th centuries AD, and a comprehensive geophysical survey revealed impressive archaeological remains, just waiting to be investigated. CAP were successful in their application for a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and with their support are conducting six weeks of excavation this year. The project is community-focussed at its very core, and volunteers are participating (for free) in every stage of the on-site work, which runs from 1st July to 10th August: excavation, wet sieving, finds processing and geophysics – and a brilliant job they areVolunteer Robyn came all the way from Ireland – only to be landed with the gloopiest feature imaginable!doing too. Volunteers range from school pupils to octogenarians, and everything in between. Five local primary and secondary schools have also participated in classroom-based workshops, and then come out and visited the site before the end of term, taking part in the excavations, wet sieving, metal detecting, finds washing and so on, and we’ve also had a visit from the local YAC. There are also weekly workshops on various specialist areas of archaeology. Sounds busy, doesn’t it? It is! There is lots going on every day but everyone involved is showing boundless enthusiasm. The sunshine has helped!Anyway,  moving on to what’s been going on in the run-up to the Day of Archaeology 2013! We are almost four weeks in to the six week programme of fieldwork, and things are getting really interesting. Our trenches were located to target specific features that had appeared through geophysical survey. This week, we have excavated an almost complete urn, which may contain cremated remains. The urn was removed intact, and will be excavated in the lab at a later date.The urn is carefully excavated to reveal its true size, then wrapped in bandages for support. Note the smiles of relief as it comes out intact! Tile-lined feature with opus signinum in situWe also have an interesting tile-lined feature, which contained a large chunk of opus signinum (a type of Roman cement). The current thinking is that the cement might have been prepared to line the feature, however for some reason the job was never completed and it solidified to the tiles below. A bit of research has found a similar feature excavated in Tuscany, which the archaeologists there interpreted as a basin. Still speculation however.Nearby is a possible kiln, which has a hard-baked clay lining. The fill of this feature was particularly sludgy, and Robyn and Clara had a very enjoyable day removing it! The look on their faces amidst the slop and squelching was something to behold! However the hard clay lining gives us more certainly that it may be a kiln, but it’s exact use is still uncertain. Postholes nearby may represent the traces of associated structures.Today Dr. Mike Allen attended site and at tea break gave our students and volunteers a talk from the point of a geoarchaeologist, a very interesting point indeed, we now understand post depositional gleying, which explains the difficulties we are having identifying some features on site.With two more weeks of digging to go, we are excited to learn more about the site. We couldn’t possibly explain it all in one post –  this is just a snapshot of life at CAP 2013 – so please come on over to CAP’s website to catch up on the rest.Culver Archaeological Project is supported by the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund.Follow the project! www.culverproject.co.uk www.facebook.com/culverarchaeology @culverprojectTo find out more about AOC, go to www.aocarchaeology.com or follow us on social media @aocarchaeology www.facebook.com/aocarchaeology The Culver Archaeological Project: kilns and cremations by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"152","As one of the Outreach Coordinators for the Florida Public Archaeology Network (FPAN), a not-for-profit program of the University of West Florida dedicated to outreach and education related to Florida’s amazing historical and archaeological resources, I see this year’s Day of Archaeology as an opportunity to extend my influence far beyond the Florida Panhandle region in which I typically work. The Day of Archaeology, in my opinion, is a wonderful international component of the every-day job of the public archaeologist.On a daily basis, the staff of FPAN, like other public archaeologists throughout the world, take on the equally difficult and rewarding task of convincing the public, a public that is largely unaware of the actual role of archaeologists, that archaeological resources are something to be valued and protected. For those I often encounter, the archaeologist can be one of any number of popular media-influenced archetypes: the “Indiana Jones,” the “treasure hunter,” or the “dinosaur specialist.” My job, and that of other public archaeologists, is to dispel these misleading images and to show how truly amazing archaeology actually is without out being any of the above. Most impressive to me is how quickly people are willing to give up those old stereotypes. When those with which we engage begin to better recognize the science, research, time, and dedication that goes into archaeological research, a deeper appreciation for the goals of the discipline, and for cultural resources in general, is often not far behind. For those who seek to understand, archaeology can provide a deep and lasting connection to the past that gives us a sense of where we are and just how far we have come!Pensacola, FloridaThe Coordinating Center for the Florida Public Archaeology Network.Summer is a fairly busy time for us at FPAN. Working out of our Coordinating Center in Pensacola, Florida, we co-direct a summer camp, present talks on local history and archaeology in a variety of venues, and host a public archaeology lab. On top of these tasks, we are constantly generating new promotional and informational materials that aid us in our goals of raising awareness about local cultural resources.I work with one of our History & Archaeology summer camp students to use an atl-atl and illustrate changes in hunting technologies throughout human history.For the first half of every day this week, I am co-directing the History and Archaeology Summer Camp that FPAN helps run through the University of West Florida in partnership with West Florida Historic Preservation, Inc. The camp offers us a chance to dedicate a week of our summer to truly engage campers in the daily life of the historian and archaeologist. The children who attend our camp are immersed in hands-on activities in history and archaeology. Campers visit our public archaeology lab, as well as local museums, historic sites, and archival collections. The camp curriculum and activities attempt to build a deep appreciation of Pensacola’s rich past and to instill stewardship for local cultural resources. While this may sound overwhelming for children, all of our campers become incredibly dedicated and the camp has consistently received excellent feedback from both attendees and parents.I speak with an audience about Pensacola’s fishing history at Fort Pickens, located in the Gulf Islands National Seashore.The demands of summer camp do not slow me down, however, and I head next to the Fort Pickens Auditorium on Gulf Islands National Seashore. In partnership with the National Park Service at Gulf Islands National Seashore, FPAN has helped put together a summer lecture series on local history and archaeology. On this particular day, the topic is my Master’s thesis work on the Red Snapper fishing industry that dominated Pensacola’s waterfront from 1860-1930. Utilizing historical documents and archaeological materials, I tell my audience the tale of the rapid boom and bust of the industry and how it continues to affect daily life in the local area (namely, the strict conservation measures on commercial fishing and the subsequent rise of recreational fishing tourism). I get a lot of great questions and some interesting insight from individuals who remember seeing commercial fishing vessels ply the waterfront in the sunset years of the industry.Working with one of our volunteers in the Public Archaeology Lab, I help identify and rough sort artifacts from University of West Florida excavations.After the talk at Fort Pickens, I put on my hat as Public Archaeology Lab supervisor and head back to our Coordinating Center. With the wonderful help of our senior intern, Tristan, FPAN invites the general public to come in a couple days a week to rough sort artifacts from actual excavations that the University of West Florida has undertaken in past years. The lab allows interested individuals to get hands-on with cultural material, the archaeological process, and, more abstractly, their past. While lab work is not for everyone, those who do come by always leave with a greater appreciation of the vigorous, but sometimes surprising, nature of archaeological analysis. Over the past few years, we have also retained a number of very dedicated volunteers who come every day that we are open.A new heritage sites and museums map that FPAN is putting together to promote heritage tourism in the Pensacola area.To wrap up a long day, I sit down to work on some of the new materials we will be releasing to promote heritage tourism in our area. By creating colorful, accessible handouts and making them available to visitor centers and popular tourism destinations, we hope to have a significant influence on visitation to the many spectacular museums and sites that feature local cultural resources.Although we are not “field archaeologists” in the typical meaning of the phrase, public archaeologists are constantly working in their local and regional communities to spread knowledge and appreciation of the many historical and archaeological resources that piece together the puzzles of the past. This type of “fieldwork” provides similar gratification and, at times, frustration as does standard archaeological fieldwork, but I have never felt entirely unsuccessful in any of the programs or events in which I’ve played a role. Even if all I was able to get across to a group is that archaeologists do not, in fact, dig up dinosaurs, I have decidedly brought my community one step closer to appreciating the roles of the many individuals who work in academic, public, and private archaeology. More frequently, however, I feel that those groups with which I talk and engage actually learn a great deal about archaeology, the role of archaeologists, and the relevance of archaeology to our modern world. Thus, a day in the life of the public archaeologist may not be filled with excavations of 16th-century Spanish shipwrecks or laboratory analysis of cultural material from 18th-century British fortifications, but it is certainly equally exciting to help the public navigate history in ways they never knew were possible.If you are interested in the Florida Public Archaeology Network, our mission, or what we do every day of the year, please visit our website (flpublicarchaeology.org) and follow us on Facebook and Twitter!The A Different Kind of Fieldwork: A Day in Public Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"153","My name is Dawn McLaren and I am a finds specialist here at AOC Archaeology Group, based in Loanhead, Scotland.  On a day-to-day basis I’m involved in analysing artefacts recovered as the result of archaeological excavations undertaken by AOC’s fieldwork team.  Most of the objects that I have the privilege of working on come from archaeological sites in Scotland but as we have offices in York and London I’m also involved in identifying finds from digs across England.  My job is to identify any artefacts uncovered and this means figuring out what material the objects are made from, what date they could be and what they might have been used for.  In order to get as much information from the finds as possible, I work closely with AOC’s fieldwork team to understand as much as I can about the context of the finds on site and their possible significance, as well as working with AOC’s conservators to ensure that the objects are cared for properly once they come out of the ground.Dawn examining the grinding face of a rotary quernstoneTo give you an idea of the range of finds that I deal with, in the last few weeks I’ve been looking at a some Neolithic pottery from a site in northeast Scotland, some ironworking waste from a Roman site in southeast Scotland and a post-medieval assemblage of iron and worked bone from an urban site in Edinburgh. As I said in my 2012 Day of Archaeology blog, each artefact I meet presents its own challenges and it definitely keeps me on my toes!  They all have their own story to tell, so let’s see what’s in store today….Today I’m examining a small group of worked stone objects from a Roman site in southeast Scotland. My first step is always to examine the individual objects in detail to allow me to observe any surface markings that might be tool marks left from manufacture of the object, wear from use or damage sustained to the object before it was deposited.  Some types of stone tools are more recognisable than others, such as this wonderful fragment of a rotary quernstone (see images), but this detailed approach allows me to categorise the wear and helps me to create, where possible, a biography of the artefact- from its manufacture to its deposition after its use had ceased.Analysing a Roman quernstone fragmentThe next stage is to catalogue the objects and this means describing each artefact in detail and taking measurements of each item.  Assisting me in this task is Marissa, an overseas student who I’m supervising here at AOC Archaeology this month on an Arcadia Internship.  The internship aims to provide training and experience in post-excavation work and is an important part of AOC’s commitment to making archaeology accessible to a wider audience and to provide valuable experience to promising students.Taking measurements of central socketHaving now looked at all stone objects within this particular assemblage, the star find for me is definitely this wonderful quernstone fragment!Roman quernstone fragmentThese rotary quernstones would have been used as a pair – an upper and lower stone – to grind grain into flour. The lower stone would remain stationary and the upper stone would be turned by hand as the grain was fed down a central hole in the upper stone.  This particular stone represents approximately one half of a lower grinding stone and has a clear series of vertical grooves decorating the edges of the stone and a convex grinding face which has been deliberately dressed to make a rough surface for the grain to be ground against.  What is really interesting about this example is that the style of the quern mimics imported Roman lava quernstones but is almost certainly made from local sandstone.For more information on our post-excavation services please check out our website:http://www.aocarchaeology.com/services/post-excavation  The Sticks and stones: a day in the life of a finds specialist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"154","Just a few years ago, unexpected events led to the necessity for me to embark on a career change late in life. And now, at 61 years old, and starting my last year in a Bachelor of Specialized Studies program at Ohio University Eastern, I’m fortunate to be serving an internship here at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex, (GCMAC), where I’ve received excellent training and hands on experience, thanks to the hard working and attentive staff at this wonderful facility. Even though my education has included a very in depth and high quality field school with the Hocking College Archaeology Department, the training that I’m receiving here at GCMAC gives me valuable insight on archaeology from a more clinical perspective, which I deem to be greatly important since my goal is to construct a broad and well rounded collection of knowledge to hopefully make myself employable in many areas of archaeology.While working here my duties have included learning how to clean, label, and number individual potsherds, faunal bone fragments, and lithics, (flakes, tools, cores, hammer stones, hematite, etc.), of which there are a very impressive number in a curation facility such as GCMAC. I’ve also been able to help with the organization of curated materials in the “state of the art” storage facility here, where artifacts from all over West Virginia are stored along with many federal and privately donated collections. Some days I work in the document viewing room, entering information from CRM reports onto an Excel spreadsheet or help in the preservation of records, documents, correspondence, etc. by making copies on archival paper, which will prevail long after the originals have succumbed to the ravages of time. At one point during my time here, the director of the facility allowed me to put my academic and field school experience to use by having me monitor a utilities company project that took place on the mound site property. Another very enriching experience was the arrival of a Native American Studies group who came to GCMAC from West Virginia University, (WVU), and stayed for a week while helping with the many tasks that need done in a large facility such as this. During that week I received instruction on prehistoric ceramic type-analysis and cataloging from a retired West Virginia Division of Highways archaeologist who accompanied the group from WVU. As for this Day of Archaeology, for this student intern it ended with my making copies of old correspondence of Ms. Bettye Broyles on archival acid-free paper for the sake of preserving old and important things. And for those who may not know who she was: Yes, the spelling of the first name is correct and she was one of West Virginia’s first female archaeologists, and an amazing woman, (worth researching!).The A Day of Archaeology for Student Intern at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

My day job is as a Contract Archaeologist for the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust  http://www.heneb.co.uk/ and my other work is writing my PhD – part time – on the topic of ‘Parks, Gardens and Designed Landscapes of Medieval North Wales and North West Shropshire’.Yesterday I received a phone call from a journalist with the ‘Daily Post’, which is the daily newspaper for North Wales.  His editor had seen my tweets about my crowd funding page for my PhD http://www.gofundme.com/medievalgardensandparks# and could he send a photographer to meet me today to take a picture to go with the article he had been asked to write.So, this morning I met the photographer at Holt Castle (Longitude 53.077958; Latitude -2.880319) to get a picture taken and also to see the excavation work being carried out there by Wrexham County Borough Council and local volunteers from the community.The castle at Holt is a bit of a hidden gem of North East Wales. You can’t see it from the road through the village of Holt, and for many years it certainly didn’t really look like a castle either. But now, thanks to several heritage organisations working together, this once beautiful building is beginning to reveal its former glory.Excavation at Holt Castle – with Cadw, Northern Marches Cymru, Wrexham County Borough Council and Holt Local History Society all working in partnership.As part of my PhD research I’m looking at the relationship of castles to their surrounding landscape and at Holt there is an excellent survival of the relationship between Holt Castle and its Little Park.Little Parks (sometimes known as Inner Parks) were constructed next to castles for the enjoyment of the owners, so they could look out of their castle windows and into their park, or ride with invited guests through the park looking at the castle as a backdrop.The view out from the apartments into the Little Park, the original boundary is the line of trees across the image with the park starting behind them.This morning I spoke to the Excavation Director, Stephen Grenter, to find out what this year’s excavations had revealed, and this afternoon I’ll be working on another part of my PhD research.  The Castles and Crowdfunding – Part One by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The fort is by far the largest in East Renfrewshire, and it was a refreshing introduction to the way that the staff at RCAHMS go about tackling these complex sites. Perhaps 2000 years old, the fort must have been an important place in the local neighbourhood, commanding extensive views of the surrounding area and modern Barrhead. It is likely to have contained a group of roundhouses where people lived and worked, and there may have been the workshops of metal workers and craftsmen in leather, wood and pottery.It was surveyed by a husband and wife team Dick and Meghan Feachem, during their work for RCAHMS in the 1950s. A more recent re-survey by RCAHMS has teased out a lot more detail and clarified the condition of the fort’s wall, which has been thoroughly robbed, the stone being use in the dykes and houses in the area.Aerial view centred on the remains of Duncarnock fort, taken from the NW.

I’m ‘piggy-backing’ a geotechnical investigation and monitoring the test pits for any buried archaeological resources. This kind of task is important as it helps gather information that could be useful later on, such as when development proposals are brought forward and their archaeological implications need to be understood. This task is also part of the bread and butter of any commercial archaeological contractor even when tedious and it ensures we are involved in the wider process; the more ‘normal’ our presence becomes, even when monitoring a groundwater engineer’s test pits, is a good thing. Back in the office there’s the digi pics to download and label up, an email to the consultant and a report to write.Next up another Written Scheme of Investigation to write, this one providing a methodology for an excavation. These documents really are vital and establish a measurement of what will ensue on site and subsequently in post-excavation.

"162","The Pitt Rivers archaeological models from 1890′sPart 3Watch our conservation video:Pitt Rivers and the archaeological excavations on his estateA retired General, Augustus Pitt Rivers inherited Cranborne Chase in 1880. Cranbourne Chase spanned over 26,000 acres across two counties, Dorset and Wiltshire. The estate contained a wealth of archaeological material from the Roman and Saxon periods and this land provided the perfect area for Pitt Rivers to investigate unspoiled archaeological remains. A systematic approachPitt Rivers excavated Cranborne Chase from the mid-1880s and whilst many previous antiquarians had been attracted to burial mounds and their beautiful treasures, Pitt Rivers was interested in a wider area of investigation. His most important innovation was to collect, record and catalogue all the artifacts, not just those most decorative treasures which were admired by his contemporaries.His approach to studying and recording the archaeology was highly methodical. He was the first to thoroughly document the stratigraphy and position of finds. On the Cranborne Chase estate, Pitt Rivers focused on the excavation of settlements and examined all the Roman and Saxon artefacts, producing illustrations. The discovery of pottery sherds for instance was indicative of everyday life and a subject worthy of study.Pitt Rivers also published his findings and illustrated his reports. By the standards of the time, Pitt Rivers was systematic in his approach to gathering information and his records are extensive. He is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist to work in Britain and archaeologists to this day acknowledge his work and legacy.Model of Woodyates Hypocaust (1888-90)3-dimensional archaeological modelsPitt Rivers was inspired to improve upon his 2-dimensional plans with 3-dimensional models of his excavations. The archaeological models which survive today in the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum are made from wood, wire and plaster of Paris.The detail, scale and accuracy of the Pitt Rivers archaeological models is extraordinary. He marked where almost every object was found…A model skeleton, created by Pitt Rivers from the Woodyates Hypocaust model: part of a Roman settlement, 1889-90Pitt Rivers displayed many of these models when he opened a museum on his estate and today, the majority of the collection (approximately 22,000 objects) is held at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford.Salisbury and South Wiltshire MuseumSalisbury and South Wiltshire Museum acquired a collection of artefacts, archaeological models and manuscripts called the Pitt Rivers Wessex Collection in 1975. The four large archaeological models from the collection had been in storage for over 30 years and had not been accessible to the public.This year, Salisbury Museum was awarded a grant from the AIM Pilgrim Trust Conservation Scheme to conserve the models. As these four models are so heavy and fragile, the Wiltshire Conservation Service moved some of its equipment to create an conservation laboatory at the museum and opened the doors to the public.The Wiltshire Conservation Service moved some of the equipment into Salisbury Museum to create a conservation laboratory and exhibition.At many museums there is only ever enough space to display a small proportion of the collection at any one time. These models are very large and although they provide a significant resource, they do take up a good deal of space within a gallery. To make the most of the gallery space, smaller examples of Pitt Rivers’ models have been on display.  By conserving these large models today, the Conservation Service will ensure that they will be protected and remain in good condition for the future.More posts to come……The The Pitt Rivers Archaeological Models by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"163","Voir toutes les ressources audiovisuelles de l’InrapJe m’appelle Alban Horry, je voudrais profiter de ce « Day of Archaeology » pour parler ma discipline, la céramologie.Si quelques mots suffissent pour définir l’univers du céramologue, donc mon univers, c’est bien ceux-ci! La céramologie au même titre que l’archéologie est un métier et c’est aussi une passion. J’aime les caractères de cette discipline, la masse des informations à gérer, participer de près à la compréhension de l’histoire d’un site et finalement, de « mettre de l’ordre dans le désordre ». La céramologie c’est aussi pour moi le partage, c’est aller à la rencontre des autres pour échanger et sortir de son propre univers. Elle n’est pas une discipline isolée mais participe d’un travail collectif. Elle est intégrée aux travaux d’une équipe archéologique afin de mettre en forme les données issues d’une fouille.Une de mes plus belles « aventures céramologiques », et je tiens vraiment à utiliser le mot aventure, c’est celle que j’ai connue lors de la fouille du Parc Saint-Georges à Lyon entre 2002 et 2004 (dont le film présente une partie du travail que j’ai réalisé). J’ai eu pour mission d’investir cette collection exceptionnelle de poteries modernes découvertes sur les bords de la Saône. Les habitants du quartier avaient alors utilisé la rivière comme dépotoir pour rejeter leurs déchets domestiques. Ces fouilles ont livré le lot le plus important de céramiques postérieures au Moyen Âge découvert à ce jour à Lyon, une collection remarquable reflet éclatant de ce que les intérieurs des maisons contenaient d’objets du quotidien en terre cuite. L’étude de ces objets vient compléter celles des lots issus des fouilles archéologiques de ces trente dernières années au cœur de Lyon, dont j’ai pu étudier une bonne partie et qui ont permis d’amasser une collection exceptionnelle de poteries datées entre le XVIe et le XIXe siècle. Cette documentation unique, qui compte à ce jour près de 400 000 fragments, a offert, offre et offrira encore aux chercheurs de riches heures et perspectives inépuisables de travail.Mon quotidien à l’Inrap c’est aussi effectuer les études et les expertises de céramiques du Moyen Age et de la période moderne découvertes lors des diagnostics réalisés préalablement aux fouilles. Ces missions de courte durée où il faut travailler vite et aller à l’essentiel visent à fournir des données de chronologie indispensables à la réalisation des rapports de sondages archéologiques. J’apprécie beaucoup ce stade de mon travail où je perçois les études que j’aurai à mener par la suite à l’issue des fouilles archéologiques.J’aime le fait d’étudier des céramiques allant du Ve au XIXe siècle, donc sur une très longue durée, ce qui permet considérablement de varier « les plaisirs ». C’est la même chose pour ce qui concerne les régions sur lesquelles je remplis mes missions tant en Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne et Bourgogne. Cette vaste entité géographique permet d’observer par exemple les phénomènes de diffusion des productions céramiques.Un des autres aspects de mon quotidien de céramologue et non des moindres, est bien sûr de communiquer les résultats de mes recherches et travaux sur les céramiques médiévales et modernes, par le biais de publications scientifiques et de participation à des colloques.Enfin, j’ai plaisir aussi à présenter mon métier et partager ma passion avec un plus large public. Ce dernier aspect me semble indispensable pour sensibiliser chacun à l’archéologie. Le céramologue travaille finalement sur des morceaux choisis du quotidien qui témoignent à leur façon d’instants de vie passée. Ils nous plongent au cœur de l’histoire, pas celle des grands événements, mais au plus proche de nous, dans celle de nos ancêtres dans leur vie de tous les jours.Alban Horry, céramologue à l’InrapThe Des milliers et des milliers de tessons… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"164","Collaborative video about our Heritage Practice module and BA Heritage Studies students at YorkI’ve participated in the Day of Archaeology since its initiation two years ago, when my post (also see my 2012 post here) coincided very closely with my appointment at the University of York (UK). I have often struggled to summarise my day-to-day professional activities because, as I’ve discussed before, they are diverse and not evidently recognisable as the stereotype of ‘archaeology’. I adore my work because of such diversity—it is always different, it is of-the-moment, it is linked to so many exciting people (curators, designers, IT experts, archaeologists and heritage officers, media specialists, journalists, etc.), it is incredibly public, and hence it comes with a deep feeling of being engaged in something that truly impacts upon other individuals. Our great Cultural Heritage Management and Digital Heritage students have themselves been very successful in progressing to jobs with a comparable degree of variety and influence.But the struggle to encapsulate my work has only intensified as my career has developed, owing to the fact that academia pulls you into so many administrative roles that push far beyond one’s expert interests. As a result, my days often entail (among other things) hours of email-writing and phone calls, organising courses and modules and reading lists and guest speakers, coordinating rooms and equipment and related specialist infrastructure, negotiating opportunities and insurance and accommodations and tools for the teams that I supervise, and reading drafts of others’ research.It has been brokering this explosion in duties that I have found an especially difficult aspect of academic life, because it tends to pull you away from the very thing that is most inspiring to you—and, indeed, the thing that you are actually recognised in the wider world for: your own research. Some aspects of the job help to reinforce or elaborate your research, including preparing for teaching, in that they demand that you scour the literature and critically interrogate the emerging scholarship. But other aspects seem a million miles away from study and discovery and analysis and the other energising components of the research process.These points have been on my mind lately as I take advantage of the couple of months of the year outside of the term-time calendar when I have more freedom to invest in my own research endeavours. I leave for Çatalhöyük next week with my great team from York, Southampton and Ege University in Turkey; our Gender & Digital Culture project is really starting to blossom (we were featured on Wednesday on the London School of Economics’ Impact blog!); I have a couple of articles and chapters now in press, and two grant applications out for review; and I’m coordinating some new projects/events for the upcoming year. But much of this work has only come together with substantial support from others: colleagues, research assistants, friends, etc.My greatest learning experience of 2012-2013, then, has surely been in navigating this collaborative form of practice, because it has necessitated a complete shift in my intellectual mindset. As a student, I was trained to work independently—a not uncommon predicament for humanists. I would do my own study, analyse my own data, and write up my own work. However, as I’ve developed as a scholar, it’s become clear that not only is such an approach actually impossible for me now, but it was also a questionable way to have been educated in the first place. It’s questionable both because professional life demands that one be adept at collaboration, and because the best ideas and scholarship come about through learning with and from others who see the world in different ways.The whole nature of how I intellectualise has had to change in order to accommodate this collaborative shift—and it has been a real and profound challenge for me. I’m having to teach myself how to relinquish control to others. I’m having to recognise that I can no longer do everything on my own and that I have to trust others to carry projects forward in my absence and help me. I’m having to learn to be comfortable with the fact that sometimes my role is now purely one of project manager, but that even here I can make a difference. Such a change in perspective has also meaningfully impacted on how I teach others, because I am concerned to ensure that my students don’t get educated in a vacuum, expecting that scholarly life will or should be an isolated activity. From my experience, nothing is more misconceived than the trope of the academic as a solitary figure. You are constantly surrounded by people—whether physically or metaphorically—who need things from you and vice versa. It’s a disservice to perpetuate the notion that independent, single-authored research is the paragon of scholarship, not least because even when such research is published, it always comes about through engagement with others. It’s also a disservice to budding academics to insinuate to them that such a model of practice is even plausible, because what results is real disconcertion when everyday reality—the multitasking and administrative load, etc.—proves it impossible and your whole epistemological outlook on research then is forced to change.On this Day of Archaeology, when I’m preparing to take my team out for fieldwork next week, and working with my colleagues on multiple other projects, I’m very reflective about its collaborative essence. Collaboration is what sums up my activities today, and it’s what now characterises me as a scholar. And, honestly, I can’t imagine good research coming about in any other fashion.Dr Sara Perry, Director of Studies, Digital Heritage, University of YorkThe Reflections of a New Lecturer on the Day of Archaeology 2013 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"165","When I signed up to Day of Archaeology I thought I would be out on site, I didn’t know where –originally it looked like a big site in London, but that has been delayed, and then it seemed I’d be up the road on a site I evaluated a couple of years ago. As the recent heat wave began I became a bit apprehensive at the idea of digging 3m wide rubble-filled ditches in the baking heat, but that site slipped too… Temple and nauli at Seeitakura, DailekhSo I am in my office finishing off the report for some recent fieldwork I did in west Nepal for the Central Himalaya Project. The project intended (amongst other aims) to record a sample of medieval stone monuments belonging to the Malla dynasty, evaluate the suitability of recording techniques including photogrammetry, and try and develop a database for future assessment and analysis. In total we recorded 58 sites, with 32 temples, assorted other sites and monuments, and over 80 architectural fragments. The fieldwork was hard work –up by 6am, lug all the gear to site, work through the day with a short break and back at 7pm for data entry and downloading. But the team was good, the weather was hot, the beer was ice cold and the scenery and locals were fantastic. It didn’t exactly feel like a ‘jolly’ as all my mates called it, but it was quite nice to be sipping single malt looking at the stars and glad there wasn’t a CSCS card for thousands of miles. Nauli or waterpointThe downside of any expedition is coming home, and with archaeology that doesn’t just mean returning to work, but writing up your results. Fieldwork somehow always seems more ‘fun’ than the grind of office-based Post-Ex, and there has been plenty of checking and cross-referencing of records, data-entry, and form-filling to do. The monument gazetteer seemed endless, the temple terminology impenetrable, and there were seemingly hundreds of drawings to check, ‘ink up’ in Corel-Draw and work out exactly what each stone fragment might represent.‘Pillar Stones’, Dailekh BazaarIn amongst the grind there are moments when it all comes together, managing to reconstruct a ‘lost’ temple from fragments of stone, the satisfaction of finding that your thoughts on temple architecture were echoed by published works, the realisation that common motifs and styles were being used across hundreds of miles and on a wide variety of monuments of both Hindu and Buddhist origin. Temples at Bhurti Mandir, DailekhThe draft report is now complete, its 160 pages, 42,000 words, and nearly 100 illustrations. At times when writing it I wished I hadn’t recorded so many monuments, but now, having completed the work I just want to go back and record more!The After the Fieldwork, the Hard Work: Post-Excavation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"166","Angus Leydic (R) (Duquesne University) helps Jen Black (L) (UC-Berkeley) measure a Roman pot.         Long hours, data entry, and cataloging seem to be examples heard in various jobs and internships, but not what people would exactly think of archaeology.  When telling friends that I would be working with Palatine East Pottery Project in Rome for the summer, people asked me whether I was going to dig for pottery, or find something that could change the world.  My only answer I could give to them was, “the dig was completed in the 90’s; I don’t suppose anything I touch hasn’t been examined already.”  That statement held some truth, but didn’t exactly become a rule.Working at the American Academy in Rome has taught me a lot about pottery, ranging from types, materials, organization and even more critical thinking.  Although working on pottery originating from Spain found on the Palatine doesn’t seem like the work my family and friends thought I would be doing, it appeared I was just checking on data collected around ten years ago.  But, when I was working with Gallic pottery from France found here, my colleague and I, two students with no background in Roman pottery, were organizing, examining, and working with works of art that have yet to be touched other than to remove them from the site and store them according to context groups.This life isn’t glamorous, but it is exciting. The team I work with, two graduate students, one from Duquesne University, my university, and another from UC Berkeley, and a professor of archaeology from UNC Chapel Hill, all work together every day to reach a common goal, to examine transport amphorae to determine origin, make, material, use, and importance in the world.  The discoveries we can make might not change the world (or will they?!), but they can be useful in finding a better understanding of ancient trade, class, or maybe other subjects too.The daily work of sorting, measuring, using Munsell’s color system, classifying and the endless  spreadsheets might come off boring and underwhelming compared to finding dinosaur bones, but there is never a time that has been dull.  Every discovery from graffiti, dipinti, and even guessing what happened to a sherd in the past makes all the work worthwhile.  For the time I have spent working in this field, the time has been more than enjoyable, entertaining and interesting.  As time nears to an end for this season my only wish is that I had more time to measure!Ciao! -AngusThe Measured Steps in Archaeology–One Young Student’s Perspective by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"167","For the last 3 weeks we have been excavating what was supposed to be a very simple site with pretty much only a big Iron Age enclosure ditch….. It turned out instead that the site was criss-crossed with small linears, ditches and gullies partially overlaid by what I can only describe for the moment as an activity area of probable Anglo -Saxon date. So we spent most of the 3 weeks trying to understand their nature, period and their relations. This was made even more difficult by the almost total absence of finds, and by the scorching hot weather.  As it happens the developer wanted his site back, so we did all possible in the time allowed and then we had to pack up.  I remained on site for a week of watching brief which, in spite of the weather suddenly turning rainy and stormy, turned out to be much more pleasant then what expected as the workers kept me supplied with hot coffee and doughnuts!During the breaks I kept going back to the excavation area to see if, after the rain, the situation might have become  clearer, but to no avail…Today though, just one hour before I was due to leave the site, the mechanical digger started working on the area we had excavated, cutting a long section all along the bulk. Even though I was not meant to check while they were going thorough the already excavated area, I took the occasion to have a look. Amazingly the digger exposed several of the intersection of the ditches, making clearer what cut what, and eve more amazingly uncovered a large deposit which contained a conspicuous amount of burnt pots, one of which was still intact before the “gentle” hand of the mechanical digger got in to it. The workers were very kind and decided to stop the digging and give me time to clean and record the sections and to take pictures. They also helped me to collect the pieces of the large pot that can now be put back together and can be used for dating!!! So I guess tomorrow the coffee and doughnuts will be on me! The Mission Impossible: Making sense of Iron Age field boundaries by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"168","East Lothian ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Sharon Beck, RCAHMSFidra IslandWhen I played at Yellowcraig as a child, I had no idea that I was following in the footsteps of one of my favourite authors, Robert Louis Stevenson. Like me, Stevenson used to holiday in East Lothian, playing on the same beaches and picking up inspiration from his surroundings. Stevenson formed the foundations of one of his most famous stories, Treasure Island after several visits to the Island of Fidra, which can be seen from the coast of Dirleton. It has been claimed that the map of Treasure Island was modelled on Fidra, which sits in the Firth of Forth, approximately two and a half miles west of the seaside town, North Berwick. Stevenson’s visits to the island were around the time the Lighthouse was being constructed in the 1880’s. RCAHMS’ archive holds the original plans which are signed by Stevenson’s father, Thomas and cousin, David who were the engineers responsible for the construction.Aerial view centred on Fidra, taken from the NW. Copyright RCAHMS (SC916492) One of several islands on the Forth dubbed ‘The Little Jewels’, from the coast, Fidra Island looks nothing more than a lump of rock in the middle of the sea with a lighthouse that is still used to this day. However; after looking through some of the Ordnance Survey Name Books on Scotland’s Places I discovered that this little island offers a lot more than first meets the eye. In around 1165, a chapel was built on the island and dedicated to St. Nicholas, and frequented by monks from Dryburgh Abbey, as well as the Cistercian nuns from the local Convent at North Berwick, who used to make pilgrimages to the Chapel. The Chapel was also possibly used as a quarantine hospital for sick sailors, and for people suffering plague; however it now sits in a state of ruin with only one wall remaining. There is also part of a railway, which I found particularly fascinating considering it’s a fairly small island. What the railway would have been used for I cannot say, as very few records seem to be available. Fidra is also home to Castle Tarbet, a pillar reaching 40 feet from the sea, with sheer drops on three sides. It’s little wonder that Robert Louis Stevenson found the island so intriguing and inspiring enough to influence his work, or perhaps it was just a tribute to his family who constructed lighthouse so iconic of the island today.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Sharon Beck (RCAHMS) – East Lothian by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"169","Hi everyone, my name is Somayyeh and I am a Council for British Archaeology (CBA), Community Archaeology Trainee based with Archaeology Scotland. I graduated from the University of Manchester in July 2012 and not long after there were a number of CBA youth focused bursaries on offer. I applied to three and was asked for an interview with Archaeology Scotland, I must have done something right as I am currently nine months into my placement! I got into archaeology as a mature student after working in the financial services industry. I always loved history as a youngster which was passed onto me by my great grandmother. I did a bit of research into history degrees and noticed archaeology as another possibility, I am quite a practical person so felt this would be an even better way of combining my love of history with a fun subject! I fell in love with archaeology and came to understand that our history and heritage should be shared, protected and conserved for future generations. I have learnt so much in such a short space of time about the benefits of community archaeology and would like to stay in this area after my bursary ends.On this day of archaeology I am driving from Musselburgh to Ardnamurchan so that I can lead a day of outreach for the Ardnamurchan Transition’s Project on Sunday. Whilst my actual day of archaeology isn’t overly interesting, the reason I am going is! I will be running a number of activities that will appeal to a wide audience but none more so than the younger generation. There will be finds handling, ancient technology with grinding of flour and a wood bow drill, there will be the opportunity for children to make their very own clay Thor amulet to take home and a geocache (treasure) hunt which will help the younger generation to see what kinds of objects might be left behind from a Viking occupation. The treasure hunt will also be a chance to explain the possible history of Vikings on the Ardnamurchan peninsula.If you are interested in the work I have done so far, feel free to check out my blog at http://archaeo-life.blogspot.co.uk/The Road Trip to Ardnamurchan on this Day of Archaeology! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"170","By Jacqui Mulville, Reader in Bioarchaeology/ Head of Archaeology, Cardiff University, WalesJust back from a week at Çatalhöyük, Turkey and still catching up on various issues.   Working as an archaeological academic is a bewildering mix of teaching, research, administration, fieldwork and engagement.So far today I have tackled opportunities for postgraduates to teach next year, read a draft PhD chapter, virtually checked up on the faunal and conservation team left out at Çatalhöyük (they are at Gobekli Tepe as I write – see Facebook for the images), checked teaching timetables, planned staffing and activities for our ‘Lunatiks and Sun worshippers’ Guerilla Archaeology event at Wilderness Festival as well as mused on the history and archaeology of Nazi sun worship and written a student reference.  It is 10.30am.We have students and staff scattered around the world in the summer months and keeping track of them all is a huge task. I have just left one postgraduate and four students out at Çatalhöyük in Turkey working as faunal analysts and conservators. Elsewhere there are groups of students excavating at Ham Hill in Somerset with Prof Niall Sharples, and crawling around caves in Montenegro with Dr Dusan Boric, as well many other students dotted around at various locations.Fieldwork is probably one of the highlights of archaeological research and we prize the process, the products and the insights from hands-on archaeology highly. Indeed at Cardiff we make all our undergraduate students do eight weeks fieldwork or conservation placements.  Some of them do not enjoy the experience, it can be muddy, frustrating, back breaking, boring, painstaking and painful – however the majority leave with improved knowledge, skills and experiences as well as a whole new raft of friends.  The challenges of working closely with other people, often away from home, comforts and familiar routines can be hard.  I always know that at the end of the first week I feel a strong urge to leave, but if I wait a day or two the whole thing suddenly slots into place and the excavation becomes a new ‘home’.This year my fieldwork has been curtailed due to an injury so I only spent a short time at Çatalhöyük over the eight-week excavation season.  I am ‘Faunal Team Leader’ and I was once again be beguiled by the giant aurochs bones and buccrania (skulls), the huge wild pigs and the tiny horses.  Aurochs have been extinct in Britain since about the Bronze Age and are extremely rare in assemblages therefore handling these huge bones is always astounding.Aurochs skull being reconstructed by a Cardiff conservation studentPart of our research at Çatalhöyük this year was focused on understanding a series of early mixed human and animal deposits found lying outside the site (excarnation, butchery, consumption) as well as continuing to look at cattle domestication (strangely late at Çatalhöyük compared to other sites in the region) and the role of wild species in this domesticating society. There are interesting changes towards the end of the Neolithic sequences – in terms of the species present, the houses, art and artefacts (including hunting tools) that seem to coincide with the appearance of domestic cattle – so were these Çatalhöyük cowboys different to their predecessors? We also are trying to map changing rates of accumulation in houses and middens to better understand how, and hopefully why, the inhabitants managed their waste.Summer for Cardiff archaeology is also festival time; we take staff, students and alumni to music festivals to tell people about archaeological research. Guerilla Archaeology is in its third year of festival attendance and kicked off 2013 with a very successful Glastonbury trip. You still have time to catch us at Wilderness, Shambala or at the London Shuffle festival (curated by Danny Boyle!). Look out for my ‘24th century BC Party People’ piece in the program at the former, discussing the archaeology of festivals.Speaking to people about my research has quickly become one of the highlights of my job. The challenges of explaining what we do and why it is interesting, important or revealing really gets me thinking about both modern and ancient humans as well as challenging assumptions and exposes the gaping holes in my knowledge. I have read more, and more widely, than ever before as a result of these interactions and whole new areas of research activities and ideas have developed from outreach activities. Just speaking to fellow academics can become rather insular and isolating, so getting out there can really impact on yourself as well as the wider public.Anyhow it is now 11:04 and the various claims on my time are calling…. so back to work. I have the final edits of a monograph on sea level change in the Isles of Scilly to complete and a Swiss grant application to review – though I would rather be at Gobekli Tepe  looking at the carved animals on the monoliths…Have a great day of archaeology! The Admin, Aurochs and Adventures: an academic’s Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"171","Je m’appelle Carine Muller-Pelletier, pour ce “Day of Archaeology”, je souhaiterais vous parler d’une journée caractéristique de ma vie d’archéologue et du site archéologique des Queyriaux, près de Clermont-Ferrand, que j’ai fouillé pendant plus de un an.5 h, allez debout. Je dois rendre un bilan scientifique des découvertes sur le site. Il faut au moins finir le chapitre entamé hier soir. J’ai beaucoup de chance, le chantier est à 15 mn. 7h30, j’ouvre le site. Déchargement du véhicule. Des collègues matinaux sont là pour m’aider. On installe le bureau. 8h, on attaque. Je fais le tour des questions, des soucis.Première étape quotidienne. Je fais le tour du chantier. 28 000 m², les vestiges sont denses partout, la course commence. On fait le point avec chacun, sur chaque secteur.Ceux en cours de décapage mécanique, ceux où les structures en creux sont coupées à la minipelle, ceux en cours de fouille planimétrique manuelle (Ouh, c’est magnifique), les relevés stratigraphiques.J’ai besoin de suivre tout ce qui se passe. Il est indispensable que j’aie une vision d’ensemble.On fait parfois des réajustements, en fonction des vestiges trouvés la veille. Ils soulèvent certaines fois de nouvelles questions. Il faut trouver les méthodes adaptées pour y répondre. On se concerte. On confronte les points de vue. Je dois trancher rapidement, c’est mon rôle.					#gallery-1 {				margin: auto;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-item {				float: left;				margin-top: 10px;				text-align: center;				width: 33%;			}			#gallery-1 img {				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {				margin-left: 0;			}																	Base du décapage mécanique et densité des structures en creux, aucun répit n’est possible ! © Carine Muller-Pelletier, Inrap																			Dégagement d’un vase du Néolithique moyen dans une fosse en train d’être coupée : on ressort la truelle qui prend le relai de la pelle mécanique. © Julia Patouret, Inrap																			Fouille planimétrique par quarts de mètre carré d’un sol d’occupation du Néolithique moyen, avec en premier plan un grand foyer à pierres chauffées. ©Carine Muller-Pelletier, Inrap																			Discussion et concertation. A droite, Carine Muller-Pelletier, responsable d’opération ©Julie Gerez, Inrap				Les spécialistes se succèdent sur le site pour récolter les données nécessaires à l’élaboration du bilan scientifique. Il faut mettre en évidence clairement le potentiel scientifique du site : état de conservation, nature des vestiges, détermination typo-chronologique, aspects technologiques, premières propositions d’interprétation fonctionnelle des zones et d’organisation spatiale par phase chronologique. Et replacer tout ça dans ce qu’on connaît déjà et dans ce qu’on peut obtenir comme réponses aux questions encore en suspend.18h00, j’enfile de nouveau mon costume de jeune maman, pour le quitter de nouveau vers 21h et poursuivre le bilan scientifique et intégrer les nouvelles données acquises dans la journée.Une période intense de 3 mois, au cours de laquelle deux bilans scientifiques m’ont été demandés : (60 et 90 pages de travail habituellement effectué en post fouille). Mais le site méritait cet investissement.En effet, l’intérêt du site des Queyriaux réside sans la présence de sols d’occupation denses et structurés, remarquablement conservés, dans les habitats du Néolithique moyen chasséen et du Bronze moyen. L’abondance du matériel collecté, sa diversité et son excellente conservation renforcent la valeur du site. Il offrait donc une occasion rare de pouvoir connecter les aménagements enterrés aux sols de circulation jonchés des vestiges, qui révèlent une plus large palette des activités humaines. L’association de ces deux sources d’information complémentaires permettait d’envisager une reconstitution palethnographique plus fidèle de la vie quotidienne des habitants .La répartition spatiale atteste une organisation de l’occupation, caractérisée par des zones délimitées et complémentaires, spécialisées dans différents types d’activités qui gravitent autour d’une zone centrale marquée par la présence de grands bâtiments. Nous avions les données nécessaires pour enrichir les connaissances encore très partielles sur les villages en contexte terrestre et aborder les questions du territoire d’exploitation, des modalités d’occupation du territoire et des réseaux d’échange des communautés et pour permettre un retour critique sur les modèles esquissés jusqu’alors.Régionalement, le site constitue un objet d’étude inédit pour le Bronze moyen qui est une période mal connue.En revanche, les sites du Chasséen récent sont nombreux. Sur la plupart d’entre eux, la présence des sols d’occupation était attestée. Cependant, dans certains cas, ils n’ont pas été traités ; dans d’autres cas, plus rares, les sols n’ont pu être appréhendés que sur des surfaces restreintes. Aux Queyriaux, l’enjeu de la demande de classement comme découverte exceptionnelle résidait dans l’objectif d’obtenir enfin les moyens nécessaires à l’exploitation des sols d’occupation sur de vastes étendues.Finalement, au bout de 5 mois d’opiniâtreté,  nous avons obtenu le classement du site en découverte d’importance exceptionnelle d’intérêt national pour le Néolithique moyen et l’âge du Bronze moyen, et nous avons passé 14 mois sur le terrain, au lieu des 6 initialement  prévus.2000 m² de sols d’occupation, répartis sur 7 secteurs ont pu être fouillés, ainsi que les 4000 structures recensées sur le site. Nous avons ainsi traversé les saisons avec la rigueur scientifique constante qui s’imposait. En parallèle, la nécropole antique qui bordait la voie romaine a été fouillée intégralement.					#gallery-2 {				margin: auto;			}			#gallery-2 .gallery-item {				float: left;				margin-top: 10px;				text-align: center;				width: 33%;			}			#gallery-2 img {				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;			}			#gallery-2 .gallery-caption {				margin-left: 0;			}																	Démontage d’un foyer à pierres chauffées et enregistrement des données. © Carine Muller-Pelletier, Inrap																			Le retour de la belle saison. © Marcel Brizard, Inrap				Et chaque jour, malgré le stress et la fatigue, je me rendais sur le site avec la même émotion. Je me disais que nous avions tellement de chance de pourvoir travailler sur un site aussi magnifique, j’avais conscience de vivre un grand moment dans ma vie d’archéologue, qui ne se reproduirai peut-être pas.

"172","As a child growing up on a wheat and sheep farm in southern New South Wales, I was obsessed with stars. The only other lights visible at night came from inside our own house. I’d go outside and look up at the Milky Way and wonder how the universe came to be. How to attain those other worlds? Why did we not have the technology to go and visit them? I longed desperately for the future.The Milky Way seen from the Southern HemisphereAnd yet, the past was equally fascinating. Around me, on our property, were the traces of a multi-layered occupation: Aboriginal grinding stones used as doorstops, trees with canoe scars standing in the middle of sheep pasture, abandoned wells dug by Chinese labourers, the farm machinery ‘graveyard’, the old pise (rammed earth) homestead now dissolving slowly back into the soil. Only in later years have some of the old farmers quietly mentioned to me the Aboriginal burials found in the sandhills, such well-drained soil for growing crops.In a long, circuitous journey, these two parts of my life came back together when I decided to apply archaeological principles to the stuff that humans have sent beyond the Earth: the stuff we now call space junk.Earth orbit is more than just far away, it’s like the land (or space) that time forgot. While on Earth we were becoming aware of the pollution caused by modern industry and the impacts of mass production and mass garbage disposal, spacefaring nations kept on merrily flinging stuff up into the sky where it would last for thousands of years.In this cosmic rubbish heap were things that caught my imagination. I’d never really thought about what satellites looked like, or their individual histories. I suppose I’d never thought about them at all. Probably most people don’t: when they hear the term ‘space junk’, they might imagine something like a scrap yard, only floating:A steel scrap yard in the USABut, you may say, why should this be archaeology and not history? Haven’t we got an abundant documentary record to tell us all about these spacecraft and their stories? Not, as it turns out. The documentary record is far from perfect, and even if it were, it doesn’t necessarily contain the answers to the questions we want to ask. Within a system of production, there are ideas and assumptions that are unquestioned and invisible: no-one writes about them, or records them, because they are the fabric of their worldview. It’s only later that we may look back and wonder why something was like that. So there may be no words or images that document a decision; there may only be the thing itself. And this is what makes it archaeology.For the moment, I have to use documents and pictures that record the iconic early spacecraft as if they were the pottery sherds, and use them to reconstruct the rest of the story: the worldview that made a spacecraft look like THIS and not THAT. I have to think about what they meant back then, and what they mean now. And what they mean individually, and what they mean as an assemblage. For the latter, my tools are also tracking data, simulations and visualisations, like this one created by the European Space Agency.Space junk in Earth orbitThis is, hopefully, a ‘before’ shot that we’ll look back on in 50 years in both wonder and disgust. The ‘after’ shot should look very different. Sparser. More evenly distributed, perhaps. It may include high densities at Lagrange points, places where the gravitational forces created by the Earth, Moon and Sun are equally balanced. These may be our space museums of the future, where we can park space junk safely out of the way and know that it will stay put.The kind of spacecraft we might want to keep, for a whole range of reasons, might be one like the TRAAC satellite, launched in 1961 by the USA. The satellite collected data about the Starfish Prime Low Earth Orbit nuclear test, which detonated some 600 km below it in 1962, taking out its solar panels. TRAAC is part of the evidence of Cold War nuclear weapons testing, at a time when space was up for grabs: the UN Outer Space Treaty, which establishes space as a global commons to be used for peaceful purposes, was only accepted by the General Assembly in 1967. So TRAAC represents a vision of space very different to how we conceive it now.Transit Research and Attitude Control (TRAAC)The thing I really love about TRAAC is that it carried the first poem into space, inscribed on one of its instrument panels. The poem was written by Thomas G. Bergin of Yale, and is both uplifting and slightly sinister, as it views human spacecraft as weapons against the gods, who have until now had us at their mercy:From Time’s obscure beginning, the OlympiansHave, moved by pity, anger, sometimes mirth,Poured an abundant store of missiles downOn the resigned, defenceless sons of Earth.Hailstones and chiding thunderclaps of Jove,Remote directives from the constellations:Aye, the celestials have swooped down themselves,Grim bent on miracles or incarnations.Earth and her offspring patiently endured,(Having no choice) and as the years rolled byIn trial and toil prepared their counterstroke—And now ’tis man [sic] who dares assault the sky.Fear not, Immortals, we forgive your faults,And as we come to claim our promised placeAim only to repay the good you gaveAnd warm with human love the chill of space.But in the last stanza, the bellicose nature of the assault weapon is turned on its head with a new vision of space. The point, for me, about this poem, is that it exists as a physical inscription, part of the fabric of the spacecraft, and its presence in space was felt to be important at the time. It’s the start of a long tradition of incorporating an element of flesh-and-blood humanity into robotic spacecraft, either as messages to those beyond us in space or to those of us who remain here on Earth.We don’t need to destroy everything currently classed as space junk, effectively over 95% of all the stuff up there, to reduce the risks of collisions from orbital debris. We can do it in a smart way by thinking through all the heritage and environmental issues. We should stop thinking of space as a black Cartesian vacuum that is unaltered by us putting things into it, or even taking them out again. After all, we stopped thinking this way about the Earth quite some time ago. If space agencies and corporations continue to apply a 1960s approach to the space environment, it doesn’t oblige everyone else to. In the 21st century, it’s junk like TRAAC that perhaps we want to keep, for what the physical body of the spacecraft can tell us, both about nuclear war in space, and the hopes and aspirations of those who sent it up.I’m Dr Space Junk, and on this Day of Archaeology, I’m going outside to look at the stars.   The ‘And warm with human love the chill of space’: the archaeologist in orbit by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"173","Massive, Open, On-line Course Reaches Global AudienceIt just so happens that this year’s Day of Archaeology falls as the Brown University Massive Open On-line Course (MOOC) reaches its conclusion.  The 8 week course – “Archaeology’s Dirty Little Secrets” – attracted over 38,000 registrations from dozens of countries around the world.Delivered by Professor Sue Alcock and others from the Joukowsky Institute of Archaeology, the course has used case studies of the work done by Brown teams at Petra, in Monserrat, at El Zotz and Abydos to put over the basic principles of archaeological thought and method.Using the Coursera MOOC platform, the course has included a mixture of videos, exercises, quizzes and, probably as important, interactions between students and faculty in the course forums. The engagement of the staff and the interaction between students – especially in the peer review of exercises – has built a loyal and enthusiastic following. Students earn a statement of accomplishment for completing the course and achieving a required score on quizzes and exercises.Professor Alcock was recently appointed as a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. She a classical archaeologist, and has been involved with fieldwork in Greece and Armenia, but she is now directing the Brown University Petra Archaeological Project (BUPAP) and is Director of the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World at Brown University.So successful has the on-line element been that today students within reach of the University are meeting up with the course faculty at the Joukowksy Institute in Providence, Rhode Island, to share their experiences face to face.The Celebrating Archeological Education & the Brown MOOC by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I would call myself a ‘community archaeologist’ – a job title which can be open to interpretation and can encompass many different activities and tasks.My Day of Archaeology is a little less active than last year’s post, and lot less active than the day I originally had scheduled. I had planned to travel over to the West Coast, visit one AaM group near Oban to give advice about how to start reporting on their results (from formal dissemination through reporting and archival submission, to wider dissemination through a Wikipedia page) and then go on to another group to help them with an open day they have planned for this weekend.Instead, I have a rare but busy day in the office which usually starts by checking emails. This is actually only my second day back after a two week holiday and yesterday my email box was bursting with around 140 emails. Ok some of those were things like Google Alerts, blog posts etc, which can be quickly scanned and then filed away, but many of the emails were from my groups, colleagues, other heritage professionals, many of which contained requests for help, advice, project updates and questions about upcoming fieldwork, workshops or new projects. I am still getting through the backlog…After email checks, I usually start to go through the dreaded ‘to do’ list, which usually seems to get longer not shorter. Today’s tasks include edits to one of my group’s interpretation leaflets (which, in addition to paper copies, will be available digitally on their website); source an image and gain permission for it to be reproduced on a groups interpretation panel; edit the text for an interpretation panel; check that the welfare facilities are in place for fieldwork starting in two weeks’ time; ring one landowner to arrange a site meeting; ring another landowner about submitting required paperwork; commission elevations for an interpretation panel to accompany a planning application; arrange space (with a computer suite) for an upcoming digital recording workshop; progress a Listed Building Consent application; arrange a facilitator for an upcoming interpretation workshop; have a meeting with a colleague about an education resource we are co-producing….and if I have time, start to review a copy of a WW2 diary for one of our outreach projects (this might be my ‘treat’ task at the end of the day!)Today must seem like a very dull day to anyone reading this post, but this is the reality of a full time job within community archaeology. In order to go out and do the fun stuff, we have to work hard to make sure everything is in place. Our groups have the passion and belief and put in so many hours to make the project successful, but not all of them have the skills to make it happen, which is where we help!The Cara Jones – A rare but busy day in the Archaeology Scotland office by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"176","East Dunbartonshire ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’My name is Peter McKeague and I work in the Data and Recording team in the Survey and Recording group at RCAHMS.  As Data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) project manager, I am involved in a wide range of projects documenting Scotland’s rich heritage and presenting it online through Canmore. I am interested in how developments in information technology help our public and professional users discover more about the historic environment around them.In 2008 I was involved in helping colleagues research and prepare maps supporting the successful nomination of the Antonine Wall as part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’To the NE of Glasgow, the Antonine Wall snakes through the modern landscape of Bearsden.  Two short stretches of the wall are visible at New Kilpatrick cemetery and visitors may also explore the remains of the Roman Bath House at Bearsden, part of the Roman fort now buried under housesBuilt under the orders of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius in AD 140s, the Antonine Wall formed the north-western frontier of the Roman Empire for a generation. Cutting across Scotland, between the Firth of Forth at Bo’ness and the Clyde at Bowling, the frontier is 37 miles long. The Antonine Wall has a turf-built rampart, in front of which is a flat area, or berm, separating the rampart from a deep ditch with a further mound beyond.  A series of forts occur at intervals along the Wall and those at Rough Castle, Bar Hill and Castle Cary may be visited.  The outline of a fortlet is set out to the west of Kinneil House. Bath houses may be seen at Bar Hill and at Bearsden. About a third of the Antonine Wall is still visible with stretches at Callendar House, Seabegs Wood and  Watling Lodge and by Rough Castle and Castle Cary Roman Forts.However, I have chosen the two short sections of wall footing on display at New Kilpatrick Cemetery, Bearsden to illustrate the frontier.  Although closely spaced, the two sections mark a change in direction of the wall as it skirts round the contours of the hillside.  The exposed sections show the stone base, on which the rampart was built providing a rare insight into the construction of the rampart. The rampart base consists of carefully dressed kerbstones with rough boulder infill punctuated by stone-lined drainage culverts.  These two short sections present a very different view from the upstanding earthworks surviving elsewhere along the wall. The stone footings of the Antonine Wall, New Kilpatrick Cemetery, Bearsden, viewed from west.

"177","Here it is, my Day of Archaeology 2013 and after a routine check of my emails and the daily news I’m ready to begin!Silbury Hill ©English HeritageI am currently approaching the end of a year-long contract as a Digital Archivist at the Archaeology Data Service in York on an EH-funded project to prepare the Silbury Hill digital archive for deposition.For a summary of the project, see the ADS newsletter and for a more in-depth account of my work so far check out my blog from a couple of weeks ago: “The Silbury Hill Archive: the light at the end of the tunnel”Very briefly, though, my work has involved sifting through the digital data to retain only the information which is useful for the future, discarding duplicates or superfluous data; sorting the archive into a coherent structure and documenting every step of the process.The data will be deposited with two archives: the images and graphics will go to English Heritage and the more technical data will be deposited with the ADS and as the English Heritage portion of the archive has been completed it is time for the more technical stuff!So, the plan for today is to continue with the work I have been doing for the past few days: sorting through the Silbury Hill database (created in Microsoft Access).Originally, I had thought that the database would just need to be documented, but, like the rest of the archive, it seems to have grown fairly organically; though the overall structure seems sound it needs a bit of work to make it as functional as possible and therefore as useful as possible.The main issue with the database is that there are a fair amount of gaps in the data tables; the database seems to have been set up as a standard template with tables for site photography, contexts, drawings, samples, skeletal remains and artifact data etc.  but some of these tables have not been populated and some are not relevant.  The site photography and drawing records have not been entered for example, meaning that any links from or to these tables would be worthless.  The missing data for the 2007 works are present in the archive, they are just in separate Excel spreadsheets and there are also 2001 data files, these are in simple text format as the information was downloaded as text reports from English Heritage’s old archaeological database DELILAH.  The data has since been exported into Excel, so, again to make the information more accessible, I’m adding the 2001 data to the 2007 database.My work today, therefore, as it has been for the past couple of days, is to populate the empty database tables with the information from these spreadsheets and text files and resolve any errors or issues that cause the tables to lose their ‘referential integrity’, for example where a context number is referred to in one table but is missing from a linking table.Silbury database relationship diagram ©English HeritageSo, this morning I started with the 2001 drawing records. The entering of the data itself was fairly straightforward, just copying and pasting from the Excel spreadsheet into the Access tables, correcting spelling errors as I went.  Some of the fields were controlled vocabulary fields, however, which meant going to the relevant glossary table and entering a new term in order for the site data to be entered as it was in the field.Once the main drawing table was completed, the linking table needed to be populated; again, this was done fairly simply through cutting and pasting from Excel.The next step was the most time-consuming: checking the links between the tables, to do this I went to the relationship diagram, clicked on the relevant link and ticked the box marked ‘enforce referential integrity’ this didn’t work which meant that a reference in one table was not matched in the linking table which meant going through the relevant fields and searching for entries that were not correct.  The most common reason for these error messages was that an entry had been mis-typed in one of the tables.That took me up to lunchtime, so what about the afternoon?  More of the same: starting work on the sample records with the odd break for tea or a walk outside to save my eyes!As much as the process of updating the database has been fairly routine, it’s an interesting and valuable piece of work for me as it is the first time I’ve ever really delved into the structure of a database and looking at the logic behind its design.  I was fortunate in that I had attended the Database Design and Implementation module taught by Jo Gilham as part of the York University Msc in Archaeological Information Systems which gave me a firm foundation for this work.  Also very helpful was the help provided by Vicky Crosby from English Heritage who created the database and provided a lot of documentation in the first instance.The next step once the data has been entered will be to remove any blank fields and tables and then to document the database using the ADS’ Guidelines for Depositors and then to move on to the survey data and reports.I’m looking forward to seeing it all deposited and released to a wider world for, hopefully, extensive re-use and research!The An ADS Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"178","Archaeological conservation is a varied profession. One day we may shift large waterlogged timbers, the next day we may be looking at minute fibre samples under the microscope. This is what we would get up to on a typical day:X-radiography (http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/x-radiography-of-archaeological-metalwork/) forms an integral part in documenting archaeological artefacts. It allows us to look beneath surface layers and record unstable objects, such as iron. An X-radiograph (x-ray) shows the shape of an artefact, which can sometimes be heavily disguised by overlying corrosion layers. It shows the condition of an artefact, such as extent of corrosion, cracks or damage from marine boring organisms and it can show construction and decoration details, such as joints, precious metal inlays or coatings. We recently carried out quite a bit of X-radiography on finds from the protected wreck London: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ehmaritime/sets/72157634780135574/ The London (http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1000088) sank following a gunpowder explosion in March 1665. It is currently being investigated as it lies in the very busy shipping channel of the Thames Estuary.Pewter Spoon from the London X-Radiograph of pewter spoonBut we go much further back in time. Large parts of our days have lately been taken up with conserving Neolithic and early Bronze Age artefacts for the new Stonehenge visitor centre. This is a huge project. Over 400 artefacts were assessed. More than 260 required conservation work. To read about the work see the most recent issue of Research News (http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/research-news-19/).One of the objects going on display at the new Stonehenge Visitor Centre being examined using an endoscope.And once all the practical work is done we can finally sit down with a cup of tea and start writing reports. Keeping records is of utmost importance in conservation. The treatment an object receives forms part of its history and we have to document this for future generations. There may be cases when old treatments have to be reversed, because materials have aged or failed. It helps if we know which materials have been used in the past. Reports also form the basis for research and can help colleagues to find solutions to their conservation problems.

"179","It’s that time of year when our historic sites (those looked after by Hampshire County Council) shake off their Spring sleeping dust and shout out for Summer holiday participation.  This weekend sees a combination of an Archaeology Activity Day at Rockbourne Roman Villa, a Young Archaeologists Club Visit to Basing House, with the latter site also hosting a special ‘conservation workshop’ (restoring the brickwork is a more or less constant concern there) and a training excavation for students from the University of Southampton.  As the ‘person in the middle’, rather than muddle, I hope,  it’s my job to find good resource material and provide exciting opportunities.Rockbourne is ‘RocDam’ at the moment as it’s linking with the archaeological work at Damerham – a neighbouring community project focused on long and round barrows.  These are obviously an archaeological world away from a Roman Villa, but there are some good points of comparison.  The project has already seen a school drama production, telling the story of the discovery of the sites and this weekend’s event will feature a new ‘excavation pit’ full of sherds, stones and bones and many other activities.  I’m currently sorting out some human bone for an osteology workshop and pepping up the site tour.At Basing, the discovery of an in situ stone fireplace, hidden for centuries in the ruins, will be a good focus for the conservation day talks, and the dig – re-examining a few trenches not backfilled in the 1960s, will speak for itself.  The Young Archaeologists should be able to have a dig and I’m busy looking in the Museum stores to find some of the material dug up 50 years ago, just in case they draw a  blank.

"181","I am an objects conservator working to help preserve museum collections in Wiltshire. Much of the work I do is with archaeological collections including the item I am working on today which is a spearhead from the Saxon period and the ferrule from the bottom of the spear.The spearhead and ferruleWhy this needs treatingThe item has been part of museum collection since the 1940s and has been treated in the past to conserve it.  A thick layer of clear lacquer was applied as part of the old conservation treatment which is not the way iron objects are normally preserved today.  The lacquer gives the object a glossy appearance and several hairs from the brush it was applied with are stuck in the coating.As well as being unsightly the coating is also ineffective. The idea behind using the coating is to prevent corrosion by stopping oxygen in the air from coming into contact with the metal. However the coating has either worn away in places or did not completely cover the object and new corrosion is forming in the gaps. Fresh corrosion can be seen as little round bubbles of orange material on the surface of the object and the corrosion is also forcing cracks to open up in the metal. If this deterioration was allowed to continue it could cause a great deal of damage to the object with fragments of metal flaking away until ultimately there would be nothing left.The treatmentTo prevent any further deterioration I am going to remove the coating and corrosion products using a technique called air abrasion. This is similar to sand blasting but done on a very small scale. The object is cleaned with fine aluminium oxide powder in a jet of air. The air and powder comes out of a hand held nozzle less than 1mm wide. I can control the air pressure and the amount of abrasive powder I am using in order to clean the object very precisely and will be working under a microscope so that I can see exactly what I am doing in fine detail. I will post another picture of the object when I have finished so that you can see the difference cleaning it has made. A colleague using a the air abrasive machineThe Conserving a spearhead by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"182","I was called a “punk archaeologist without borders”, the first time by Ph.D. candidate Aaron Barth in his blog, The Edge of the Village. It’s a title I share with Bill Caraher, fellow punk archaeologist, and one who helped out me as same. And while I hope Dr. Caraher does blog today for the Day of Archaeology on all things archaeological and punk, I wanted to focus on how things have changed for me as an academic archaeologist into one who really would like to free your data, apply archaeological concepts/methods to non-traditional venues, exploring places on the planet other than Greece, and integrating a punk DIY attitude towards the publication of archaeology in both traditional and new media for both traditional and new subjects.(Andrew Reinhard, Punk Archaeologist without Borders. Photo by the author.)Yesterday I cheered as we went to press for Ronald S. Stroud’s volume on the inscriptions from Corinth’s Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, published by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA) where I am the Director of Publications. Today I’ll create the PDF eBook for it, adding bookmarks, but more importantly, adding outward-facing links to people and place authorities that are both online and open access, thereby adding extra context to an already rich publication. I’ve been called out twice in the past week by two different archaeologists to define the ASCSA’s position on publishing non-2D material (e.g., 3D scans, images, models, reconstructions, etc.), and while I craft my positive responses to these challenges, I’ll say now that I want every author publishing on any site to do his or her best to provide not only 3D manifestations of what’s been excavated and interpreted, and to at least experiment with 3D scanning an mapping to support their publications. Sebastian Heath, another punk archaeologist (although he might not yet know it), has been experimenting with 3D and archaeology. Have a look. Ideally I’d like to have excavations submit schema for 3D printing of what’s traditionally been the plates section of their monographs so that readers can hold scale models of what was recovered on excavation. And I’d like to publish complete data sets online to support the text in a book or article.My work at the ASCSA has also led me to rethink the archaeological guidebook. We’re currently working on the Athenian Agora Museum Guide and the Corinth Site and Museum Guide. Both will be traditionally published, but there will also be an eBook available. Most importantly though will be the apps that I’ve been developing on the Inkling Habitat platform initially for the Athenian Agora Site Guide, but ultimately for any guidebook the ASCSA cares to produce. I’m building the apps myself, creating a heavily linked system of intra-document jumps, along with other links out to places like Pleiades and to ascsa.net to provide readers with added value of additional, deep content managed elsewhere on the Web. The guides now read less like a book, and behave more like the Web, allowing meandering visitors to use the guide in a non-linear, more organic way. The bugbear has been adding real-time “where-am-I” functionality, but I am close to solving that final puzzle. The ASCSA’s journal, Hesperia, has had its backfile on the ASCSA website as Open Access content for about a year. We’ve seen no drop in revenue, and an uptick of usage especially by those people who do not have access to JSTOR while in the field. The journal is at a crossroads, too, and the only thing keeping it from going e-only (with an option for readers who want print to order copies as print-on-demand) is the fact that most of our international exchange partners still require print copies for their libraries and cannot handle (or do not want) PDF issues and/or access to JSTOR for whatever reason. To continue these exchange partnerships, we have to continue producing short print-runs (under 500 copies), which is expensive in such small numbers. Printing more copies does not cost appreciably more because of economies of scale. I am left wondering when many of our international exchange partners will turn the corner and begin to accept the digital edition of our journal as opposed to requiring print. How can I best serve their readers until that happens, and is there a more efficient way to deliver print to those universities who still need/want it?Outside of the ASCSA, I continue to be involved with a number of archaeological projects. This is where the “without borders” moniker kicks in. I’m currently wrapping up the editing of the Punk Archaeology book created from the Punk Archaeology unconference held in a bar in Fargo on Feb. 2, 2013, where there was spoken word (listen here), and punk rock (listen here) on topics ranging from what Punk Archaeology is to the archaeology of punk in the Red River Valley. The brainchild of Bill Caraher with Kostis Kourelis, Aaron Barth, Richard Rothaus, and others, this one-night stand of public archaeology resonated with both academics and locals, getting our science out of the Ivory Tower and into a drinking establishment (where many of us know the best discussions happen). The Punk Archaeology book will be published later in 2013 by the University of North Dakota, and it will be awesome.I also launched a blog that explores the archaeology in (and of) video games. Read Archaeogaming here (and contribute!), and follow along on Twitter @archaeogaming. (World of Warcraft screenshot from Archaeogaming)Lastly, I had the good fortune to be a member of the Adventure Science team that explored and documented the state of the wilderness as part of the North Dakota Badlands Transect, aka “100 Miles of Wild“. We’re pulling together the white paper now, and will follow up with a website and at least two books about what we found out there, including archaeology, ecology, geology, and more.I’m proud to be a punk archaeologist without borders.

"183","I’m Alex, a course designer and teacher at the University of Leicester (and an Archaeology graduate/researcher by background). Although I work across all Humanities subjects, much of my day to day work tends to be Archaeology- or museum-themed; and this week in particular has been full of it.One of the puzzles from the Archaeology Challenge, launched today. Can you solve it?This morning, I sent out two rather odd images to a cohort of undergraduate distance learning students on our BA Archaeology degree. The images are puzzles 8A and 8B in a 10-week puzzle game called the Archaeology Challenge which I run. Each week, the students get two puzzles which relate to the work they’re doing in their course books – the puzzles pick up key concepts and send the students off into real resources or data sets to apply their skills and find the answers. This week’s relate to identity and symbols, and to evaluating evidence: there’s an inevitable (and useful) link to some of the Richard III material from this one, which gets the students working with up-to-date evidence (see example image).Richard III is all around us at the moment, of course. The second period of excavation is finishing down in the town centre, and today we might get more news of the stone coffin which was found earlier this week (I’m keeping my eye on Twitter and the Dig Blog). Earlier this week I was interviewed on BBC local radio about a national teaching award, but half of the interview ended up discussing the local dig and Archaeology in general.  Richard III  also casts his shadow over my afternoon activity: continuing work on a new ‘MOOC’ (massive open online course) we are developing to launch with Future Learn later in the year.I’m overseeing both MOOCs we are creating, but one focussed on England at the time of Richard III is occupying most of my time at the moment. Together with Deirde O’Sullivan, we’re planning all sorts of interesting trips to archaeological sites for short film sequences, or studies of particular objects, to accompany the course narrative. I’m writing a section on late medieval manuscripts and early printing, so I’ll be interspercing the planning with some periods of writing.As I told the radio interviewer earlier in the week, my Archaeology degree and earlier work in the field fuelled my sense of adventure and investigation – and gave me a large toolkit of skills from the humanities and sciences to draw on. I still retain this desire for investigation, and this multi-disciplined approach to problem solving, with me in all I do: all thanks to that Archaeological base.The Creating Future Archaeologists: University of Leicester by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"184"," East Ayrshire ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’We’re Dooned, we’re all Dooned!In the age of austerity that surrounds us today, government worry about wasting money on ventures which swallow vast sums of cash. Often we look back when things seems more straight forward, where everything was built without the problems that modern projects seem to encounter. But was that really the case?During the First World War the conflict in the air was changing fast and Britain was having real problems. There was a requirement to teach pilots and aircrew the art of aerial gunnery. Colonel Sefton Branker convinced the government to establish a gunnery school, based on a site in France. What was required was an inland body of water with steep hills surrounding it for target ranges.  Loch Doon in East Ayrshire was selected for the new school.The location was remote, lying on the border of East Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway. Construction started in September 1916 with a railway being built to supply the material. The level of Loch Doon had to be raised by 6ft to provide a suitable area for seaplanes to land and take off and to provide hydro power to the site. 15000 construction workers and 500 servicemen had to be transported and accommodated as well as the illegal use of 1300 German PoWs. They all required buildings, power, heating, water, food, entertainment and of course toilets with requirement for sewage works.View of part of the extensive camp site with trackways or possible tramways, building foundations and sewage plant (bottom left by the Lochside).

Licensed to: RCAHMS for PGA, through Next Perspectives ™On the east side of the loch, a flat area of boggy ground was chosen as the airfield. A seaplane hangar was built to the north of the main airfield site.Target ranges were to be built on the remote west site of the loch with piers and jetties constructed, before the ranges could even built. But this massive project started to go wrong, very wrong indeed.At the airfield, the hangars and associated buildings were built whilst attempting to drain the bog. But after 56 miles of drainage pipes and tonnes of soil, the bog refused to be drained.The concrete base of the former seaplane hangar. The slipway leading into the water can just be seen below the water. Licensed to: RCAHMS for PGA, through Next Perspectives ™The airfield was abandoned after 6 months work, the hangars dismantled and a new airfield built almost 8km to the north by Dalmellington. The problems mounted up; the site was too remote, the new airfield too far away, the weather and topography limited the amount of flying time.  Additional work was required at the new airfield to divert the River Doon in a new channel lined by tiles, to allow the level of Bogton Loch to be reduced.  With improvements to aircraft, the techniques to be taught at Loch Doon were no longer valued. Finally, the need for the railway to be extended to Loch Doon by means of a tunnel was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The government called a halt to any more work and as quickly as it came it was dismantled and abandoned. The costs were never revealed in total but between £350,000 and £3 million was spent, which is between £16 million to £137 million at today’s prices. The site of the abandoned airfield on the shores of Loch Doon.

Licensed to: RCAHMS for PGA, through Next Perspectives ™Much of the site was lost when the Loch was raised some 10m in a 1936 hydro scheme. But recent aerial images taken when the water was extremely low, down to 1916 levels, revealed much of the site. In particular the hangars for the airfield and for the seaplane have been revealed. Detailed examination of these images have allowed us to record the true scale of this site and identify key parts of the site which have been submerged for decades. The Commission in partnership with Historic Scotland have recorded this site in more detail as part of The First World War Audit Project to record the surviving remains of the great war.This massive construction project was a complete and utter failure, ill-conceived and over budget. What it does leave us with is the physical remains of a very ambitious scheme and a unique perspective of the remains of an extensive complex of sites for civilians, military personnel and prisoners of war.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.  The Allan Kilpatrick (RCAHMS) – East Ayrshire by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

An initial summary can be viewed here. The issues of the Historic Scotland/RCAHMS merger come into focus.   Fiona Hyslop has recently stated that ‘This government does not look at our cultural life and our heritage as if they are merely products that can be bought and sold………I want Scotland to be a country where everybody cares about, shares and champions our culture and our heritage’ so lets hope this sentiment is held to!   I then read about this BIG Dig for the start of Scottish Archaeology Month in September with a community dig looking for a previously recorded (but now lost)  Roman Fort in the Comiston/Fairmilehead area of Edinburgh on the weekend of 30th/31st August.  Well this made me think – I have to put this on Facebook.Raised beach and cliff at Auldhame – East Lothian … but once… the land stretched out to cover the North SeaBIG mistake!   While on facebook I note that there is a story on Western Australia’s submerged landscape – I am intersted in this given the massive submerged landscape just outside my door ( ish)  with DoggerLand - and the recent work and survey of it.   showing how archaeology and paleo-enviromental work does have relevance to today’s climate challenges.   Well what could I do?   I had to read the Quaternary article and then write it up for Past Horizons as an article – should be edited and ready tomorrow.   While I was at it, I decided to check what was happening in the world, and while gathering news bulletins, I found a fascinating piece on Icelandic archaeology calling for the Tourism Organisations to start promoting the archaeology – to take the strain off the natural wonders.    Now…   where was I?3D modelling of St Mary’s Church prior to adding heatmap textureAn urgent orderSuddenly Maggie calls out…  and just as I begin to work on a heatmap of bulletholes in St Marys Church Haddington (more of that later!)  I have to drop everything and make 5 A3 drawingboards  for an order…  gah….   1 hour and another cuppa later…  and I am back at the desk and quickly bring a lost contractor back into the fold of the BAJR Contractors -   a pleasant phone call and all is well.  they are on the map and the number of BAJR Registered companies rises to 637   -  yipes!   I am promising to get the mapping system changed by the end of the day as well…   I want it back to the searchable joy it was before.  so I better get on with that.  but I better finish the heatmap…  but I also better check out this new Archaeological Insurance scheme.   could be a winner for some and a real benefit.   Hmmm…     we’ll see.Now….  where was I? The Well this is going well. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Having recently finished a Masters in the Conservation of Historic Objects at the University of Lincoln and moved home to Salisbury, I was looking for opportunities to gain further experience in the field.Opportunities for post-graduate conservation experienceI had been volunteering with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, and the Finds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire suggested I get in touch with the Wiltshire Conservation Service to see if there were any suitable projects.  I got involved with this project as the four models were being treated on site in the lecture theatre at the Salisbury & South Wiltshire Museum. The models were too large, heavy and fragile to transport back to Chippenham, which is where the Conservation Service has a laboratory.To learn more about volunteer opportunites, contact us:conservationartifacts@wiltshire.gov.uk  or call +44 (0)1249 705500Rachel designs exhibition panels for visitorsI started by researching the models, and writing information boards explaining who General Pitt-Rivers was and why the models are important – each day we opened our temporary laboratory to the public and explained what we were doing. The archaeological models had been in storage for over 30 years and had not been accessible to the public. It was a rare opportunity to see them on display as part of the conservation exhibition. We wanted a bit of background information for people to read about condition and treatment we were carrying out on the models at the time.Photographing and documenting the conservation treatmentAfter setting up all the equipment in the temporary lab, we started by photographing each model and writing a detailed report of their condition and any damage.Two of the Pitt Rivers’ archaeological models before conservation treatmentAssessing materials and conditionOne of the models is made of solid wood; the other three consist of a wooden frame filled with plaster of Paris, each model being painted to show the lay of the land around the site and with captions explaining what was found. All four models were dusty, had cracks in the wood or plaster and areas where the paint was lifting.Before treatment: visible dust and dirt on the surface.So we cleaned the less fragile areas with a brush and smoke sponge to get rid of the loose dirt and then used a diluted adhesive to consolidate the fragile areas before cleaning them in the same way.Rachel is cleaning the Rotherley excavation modelThree of the models have previously been attacked by woodworm (and at least two of them are still being eaten away), and so treating the pest problem is next on the to do list.Woodworm damage To learn more about volunteer opportunites, contact us:conservationartifacts@wiltshire.gov.uk  or call +44 (0)1249 705500More posts on this project to follow……The Volunteering with the Wiltshire Conservation Service by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"188","Basing House, Hampshire – In the mid 1960s the Aldermaston Archaeological Society did several seasons of work on the fringes of Basing House. In particular they sectioned the Civil War defensive siege works and found significant layers of late Iron Age and Roman activity sealed beneath them.The results of the excavations were rapidly published in the Hants Field Club Proceedings, but  the ‘grid box system’ they employed was never properly backfilled. This left the trenches as an unsightly rash on the smoother contours of the siege works and Hampshire County Council obtained SMC to re-examine the site and restore the original profiles.  This in turn has led to a partnership with the University of Southampton who, earlier in the year, used the site to teach their geophysics module. Now that the digging season is upon us, a training excavation is re-opening and redefining  the trenches of 50 years ago.  It’s early days, but the students are already getting to grips  with the layout of the original dig. Local society members are taking part too, and the dig has a strong community education aspect.

"190","Lorsque j’ai été contacté pour la réalisation du diagnostic archéologique de la place de la mairie de Viarmes, j’ai d’abord été stupéfait.  J’habite cette petite ville située au nord de Paris depuis vingt ans. Jamais l’idée de faire de mon lieu de résidence un objet de recherche ne m’avait effleuré. Je pratique l’archéologie depuis une trentaine d’années. J’ai commencé à exercer au sein d’associations archéologiques locales puis à  l’AFAN. Je travaille désormais à l’Inrap, dont la création remonte à 2002. Au cours de ma carrière, j’ai travaillé sur les villes de Villiers-le-Sec, de Villiers-le-Bel, de Louvres, j’ai étudié de nombreux sites médiévaux et j’ai même fait une découverte incroyable, à Baillet, en mettant au jour les statues soviétiques de l’exposition universelle de 1937 !Mais revenons à Viarmes.  Tout commence lors du diagnostic archéologique, en janvier 2012.Le bureau du maire est à quatre mètres. De sa fenêtre, il voit apparaître, en même temps que nous, un sol pavé de terres cuites colorées XIIIe siècle.  Mon collègue et vieux complice Nicolas commence à dégager un sol bicolore jaune et vert. La tranchée continue avec un  large creusement dont on ne peut atteindre le fond. À une largeur de douze mètres, nous heurtons un large mur en pierre de taille : une tour et son fossé. Nous comprenons que nous venons de trouver un château fort.Au même moment,  Pierre, ancien professeur de mathématiques et mémoire vivante de la ville de Viarmes, me contacte pour me signaler la découverte, ancienne, d’un curieux objet en argent retrouvé dans une tranchée d’assainissement, non loin du diagnostic. Il s’agit d’une petite matrice de sceau qui représente la tête d’un chevalier avec son heaume et un blason. On y discerne également une inscription. Avec mon collègue Marc, nous la déchiffrons : “Charlot de la Courneuve”. On croirait un canular, nos bureaux se situent, depuis 2009, dans la ville de La Courneuve ! Quelle coïncidence !Le château médiéval, enfoui sous l’esplanade de la mairie, avait en fait été  “oublié”. Ses voûtes, révélées lors d’aménagements dans les années 80, avaient été interprétées comme une salle de garde du XVIe siècle. Suite aux résultats du diagnostic archéologique, une fouille préventive est prescrite. Elle débute en juin 2013 pour une durée de 50 jours. Mon équipe se compose de Nicolas, qui a effectué le diagnostic avec moi, Eddy, avec qui j’ai fouillé à Marne-la-Vallée et à Serris, Marc, qui partage mon bureau à La Courneuve et participe à la fouille programmée du château d’Orville et Hervé, que j’ai connu à Serris en 1989. Des stagiaires nous assistent également durant le chantier.La fouille commence par un terrassement à la pelle mécanique avec l’aide de l’assistant technique, Saïd et du pelleur, Harry.  Ce décapage permet une plus grande ouverture du site et fait apparaître les vestiges de façon spectaculaire.Une dalle ciment recouvrant une ancienne latrine située dans la cour est enlevée. C’est ainsi que nous apercevons l’ampleur du mur d’enceinte conservé sur plusieurs mètres de haut. Il donne sur le logis seigneurial. Les bases de deux fenêtres, coupées par la rue voisine, laissent deviner la salle. Manifestement tout a brûlé. Une épaisse couche incendiée est retrouvée dans le fossé adjacent : Cette partie du château a été détruite à la fin de Moyen Âge. La tour d’angle, aperçue lors du diagnostic, surgit. Un glacis en pierre de taille lui confère l’allure d’une pyramide.Un deuxième édifice livre une pièce pavée au décor formé de carrés jaunes et verts, agrémentés de carreaux historiés. L’abondance des découpes complexes et des carreaux historiés, sur les côtés et au dessus, indique un pavage sophistiqué. Un étage qui surmonte cet ensemble est accessible par un escalier.  On y trouve une salle de vingt mètres de long riche en décors : aigle, cerf, sagittaire, léopard, l’agneau pascal apparaît.  Nous y découvrons aussi un écu orné de coquilles Saint-Jacques dorées (ressemblants à des personnages de Pac-man d’après Olivia) : il s’agit des armories de Pierre de Chambly, seigneur de Viarmes. L’édifice a  vraisemblablement été construit à la fin du XIIIe siècle par “notre ” Pierre VI de Chambly.La fouille de la seconde pièce, au sol de plâtre surcreusé, présente les stigmates d’un violent incendie plus ancien que celui du château.Reste à questionner les chroniques pour retrouver les circonstances du drame. Incursion de Charles le Mauvais (le traître hollywoodien de l’époque de Jean-le-Bon) avec des mercenaires anglais ?  Ou bien La grande Jacquerie  de 1358 ?Le terrain peut apporter quelques réponses, en fournissant des tessons ou des monnaies qui aideront à dater, et d’autres indices.  Heureusement qu’il nous reste encore trois semaines de fouilles!Découvrir la fouille de Viarmes en vidéoFrançois Gentili, archéologue à l’InrapThe Un « Day of Archaeology » à Viarmes (France) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"191","Susan Hamilton, RCAHMSDundee ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Spotting DundeeMy very first role at RCAHMS, back in 2000, was a short-term contract in the Collections team.  It was a wonderful job for a brand new archaeology graduate, as I got to know the Commission’s collections; not just the archaeological archives and photographs that I was already vaguely familiar with, but also the huge range of architectural material, and the massive aerial photographic collections.Working with aerial photography took up much of my time in my first few months. RCAHMS holds a lot of early aerial photography, including surveys of Scotland undertaken in the years following the Second World War, when RAF pilots who had been undertaking overseas reconnaissance missions took part in Operation Revue. This provided detailed domestic photographic coverage for use by the Ordnance Survey in mapping, and also helped guide post-war reconstruction.Hilltown, Dundee, showing the distinctive rectangles of the football stadia towards the top right. 10 April 1946. Copyright RCAHMS (NCAP Reference: 006-001-000-141-R)This early aerial photography is of great use to archaeologists today as it pre-dates the large-scale plantings of the Forestry Commission, thus providing some of the only evidence of archaeological sites subsequently shrouded in tree cover.Amongst other Collections Assistant tasks, one of my duties was to check through what must have amounted to miles of photographic negatives – the products of Operation Revue. In particular, I was looking for signs that cellulose nitrate film had been used.Used until the 1950s for aerial photography, cellulose nitrate film can degrade over time and become volatile, releasing poisonous gases and catching fire easily.  The temperatures at which this can happen are relatively low – around 38 degrees centigrade, and although all the RCAHMS film canisters were stored in a secure, temperature-controlled store, it was very important to carry out a thorough check for this type of stock.In the first round of checking, it was enough to open the tins one by one, and check for indications of cellulose nitrate film. A small number were found – the film having reacted with the metal canister to produce a distinctive brown powder and acrid smell. They were safely disposed of, the film having decomposed too much to be useable.Once the initial fast checks were completed, I moved onto more general condition checking. Although the fast check had demonstrated that most of the film was of less hazardous types, research had shown that different types of film were often spliced together to create larger, continuous rolls, so there may still have been some cellulose nitrate lurking in the collection.To carry out the condition checking, I loaded the spools of film onto a hand winder, and whirred through the negatives.This is where Dundee comes into the story.Oblique aerial view of Dundee, 1948, with original cropmarkings Copyright RCAHMS (NCAP Reference: 006-001-026-209-R)There were a lot of films to check, so I couldn’t spend a long time looking at images – although it was tempting.  It was difficult to make out much detail at first, as the risk to cellulose nitrate from any form of heat meant that the films couldn’t be viewed on a light box.  As an Edinburgh native, I could occasionally make out the regular streets of the New Town, but other than that I was surprised and frustrated at how little I could identify.  However, as I began to get my ‘eye in’ I quickly noticed how certain features stood out, especially in smoke-filled, uniformly-arranged urban areas. As a football fan, my eye was often drawn to football pitches with their distinctive markings and I realised that the only city I could quickly identify as I was whirring across it was Dundee – because the two football clubs in that city have their stadia across the street from one another!  ‘Spotting Dundee’ became a game I played whenever the task became a little tedious, and I also began to regularly recognise the sinuous paths up Dundee Law.image of oblique aerial view centred on the S part of the prefab estate, taken from the NE. Copyright RCAHMS (SC1111732)Once I recognised Dundee, I could also make out some of the nearby coastal towns in Angus, and this led to my best discovery – an incredible moment-in-time shot of prefabricated housing being delivered and constructed in Arbroath.  The image seems to have been taken from a much lower height than others – I like to think the pilot was going in for a closer look! Since that first contract, I’ve been lucky enough to have a range of posts at RCAHMS, but I will always have great memories of that first job and introduction to aerial photography.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.   The Susan Hamilton (RCAHMS) – Dundee by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

She was right of course but hey, we still found this decorated brick pretty sexy. Comes from the PCA site at Kings RoadA couple more for this round. One of LAARC’s recent volunteers @TinctureOfMuse has our favourite discovery. Low numbers produce old sites = things that need a bit better packaging. Here’s what we discovered on shelf 12 (another Brockley Hill excavation)This was inside though!Here’s how we discovered it: Opening the boxesFinally in this round, Thanks to @TheHeronEC2 for suggesting shelf 26 which produced a couple more bits of Roman samian pottery, excavated at Noble Street way back in 1949. These two bits however should really fall into part two, our registered finds. So thanks @TheHeronEC2, you’re contribution has helped us discover objects that should be in another part of the archive! And these objects have a pottery maker’s stamp on (left) and a bit of etched roman graffitii ‘Bii’ (right)Next up it’s our Registered finds: objects assigned an individual number (akin to an museum accession number) because they are of particular interest. The stamp and graffiti are examples as well as something obvious like a coin.

"193","I was meant to be working on site today; at less than an hour’s drive up the road it would have made a pleasant change from working several hours’ drive away, but the site start date has slipped. It’s a fairly common occurrence and can happen for any number of reasons, sometimes down to delays in planning permission or due to other construction work, the client’s cash flow, or sometimes just the weather. Sometimes sites go into apparent hibernation and only resurface months or even years down the line, when suddenly you get a call or an email saying that ‘the footings are being pulled next week, where are you’!On this occasion it is due to planning control and not yet having the Written Scheme of Investigation signed off –this is the document that says what we will do on site (and afterwards), and how we will dig and record it, and it has to be approved by the local Planning Archaeologist within the relevant local authority. Ours is still in limbo, so the site can’t start.Managing the flow of work is never easy, and is part of the reason why site staff contracts are often short, and not extended until the last minute –no-one knows if the work will be there on Monday. When you are a sole trader it gets harder –you either need to be able to clone yourself to deal with a glut of work, or find something to fill the hours when a job slides. It is almost always outside your control, and sometimes there seems to be little that can be done to mitigate the problem.My freelance work is luckily not restricted to site work –I’m also an illustrator, create training materials, do grant-funded research and I carry out post-excavation and publication work on various archaeological projects. All this work often has slightly less demanding deadlines than the fieldwork -it has to be done, but the deadline is usually ‘tomorrow’, rather than ‘yesterday’. So having a mix of different types of projects gives me the flexibility to be able to deal with last minute delays to sites. Picking up and putting down projects every few days isn’t the most efficient way of working, but  sometimes you have to do it: its a juggling act.Day to day the juggling of current jobs is usually ok, and you do get the occasional day off to counterbalance the runs of 18 hour days required to meet deadlines. The bigger impact of slippage is in tendering for future work as it may take a month or longer for sites or PX programmes to go live, and all the time all your jobs are slipping, being brought forward, and morphing from one day watching briefs into three week excavations. The Year Planner starts to look like 4-D Tetris, and its often only at the last moment that it all comes together.So today, instead of digging a late prehistoric/Roman and medieval site next to a pub in the Cotswolds, I am finalising the report on a project I did in Nepal earlier in the year…The In limbo: site slippage and juggling jobs by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"194","The Homepage of of Trafficking CultureFriday 26th July, 2013.Hello. My name is Suzie Thomas, and I’m a Research Associate at the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, at the University of Glasgow. I work on a really exciting project, so exciting that the European Research Council  decided to fund it for a whole four years (we are well into year 2 at the moment). Our project is called Trafficking Culture , and as is stated on the website’s home page: ‘Trafficking Culture aims to produce an evidence-based picture of the contemporary global trade in looted cultural objects.’ It’s interdisciplinary, which makes for a rich and informative working environment.We work at a global level, with regional research taking place in parts of South America, South East Asia and Eastern Europe, to name but a few areas. We have PhD students attached to the project, all of whom have really exciting research topics planned. We also disseminate useful information through our website, such as an ever-growing resource of relevant publications, and often previously-unseen or previously-unavailable data (which we hope fellow researchers can use in some way). My favourite section by far though is our Encyclopedia, in which we present better (and also less well)  known case studies of looting, theft and trafficking, and also some useful terminology. We all write entries for the encyclopedia, and sometimes guest writers provide entries for us too, like this interesting piece on the Everbeek Roman Silver Hoard in Belgium. Some of my own entries include pieces about the thefts from, and recoveries to, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the saga of the  Salisbury Hoard, and definitions of looting-related terms like Tombarolo.Me, during my Visiting Fellowship at the University of Helsinki in March/April. I like cold places, and I really like finding out about cultural object issues that are less well known.So, as you can see, we have a pretty cool project here. In fact, two of my colleagues are in Cambodia and one is in Bolivia on fieldwork as we speak. And what about me, on today the official Day of Archaeology? I’m in Glasgow.I had visits to Finland and Estonia (I’m interested in the Baltic region) earlier in the year, and I even got to be a keynote speaker, for the first time in my career, in Brussels back in May. But right now, I have a very quiet office and lots of transcribing to do. I can’t tell you the content of the transcripts, and our informants are completely anonymised. But let me assure you, it is really interesting stuff. Which makes up for the fact that it is still transcribing.Later on today, I will probably review a draft chapter for a new book which I am co-editing with a Criminology colleague from Loughborough, which will be all about Heritage and Crime. This book will cover some of the issues around global trafficking of looted cultural objects, but will also explore other types of crime that can affect heritage, with some very interesting case studies from different parts of the world. I am excited about this, too.I’m also primarily responsible for our social media presence on Facebook and Twitter, so it would be remiss of me not to ask you to ‘Like’ us (www.facebook.com/TraffickingCulture), and to follow us (@CultureTraffic). For Tumblr fans, we even have one of these (traffickingculture.tumblr.com).In what I optimistically refer to as  my ‘spare time’, I am also one of three Editors (joined recently by two Assistant Editors) for a brand new Journal – the Journal of Community Archaeology and Heritage. This also has Twitter (@CommunityArchae), a blog (journalcah.blogspot.co.uk), and Facebook (www.facebook.com/JournalOfCommunityArchaeologyAndHeritage).This is my other passion, you see. As well as trying to understand and maybe even suggest solutions to the global problem of smuggled and trafficked cultural objects, I also really love community archaeology. It’s just such a great idea, and it gets more and more interesting as you start to explore how it is developing in different ways and to different extents in various cultural, socio-economic and legislative settings across the world. We’re all very excited for the papers that will appear in the journal to reflect this rich diversity, and are looking forward to its official launch in 2014.Later, I’m away for the weekend.

"196","Dumfries and Galloway. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’I’m Lynsey Halliday, one of the collections trainees here at RCAHMS on the yearlong Skills for the Future Programme. My role here at RCAHMS is to develop archival skills, including cataloguing archaeological documentary archives and architectural drawings. I have recently catalogued a collection of Anthony C. Wolffe material, an architect with an impressive portfolio of architectural work in Dumfries and Galloway. While working with the A.C Wolffe collection, I discovered a batch of unidentified photographs. Investigation revealed that several of the photographs were of Parton Village, which is situated alongside Loch Ken and the River Dee in Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway. As you can see from the photograph it is a little idyllic ‘L’ shaped village.General view of Parton Village, taken from the ESE. Copyright RCAHMS (DP082914)Struck by this quaint terrace of cottages, I wanted to find out more about them. The place name of Parton is first recorded in approximately 1275, and is probably derived from the Old English ‘paerr-tun’. The existing cottages were built by B. Rigby Murray in 1901 when flooding made it necessary to raise the level of the previous cottages, which had housed the slate quarry workers. The slate quarry (behind the cottages) is thought to have been exploited from the 1750’s onwards. The cottages built by Rigby Murray are still lived in today. There is little visible evidence for the earlier settlement, in part due to the ephemeral nature of its buildings. Indeed comparatively little is known, and the remains which can be identified and dated are scattered and only form an incomplete narrative.Canmore Mapping displaying sites in the area around Parton Village. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’So what of the surrounding area? Using RCAHMS Canmore mapping database, I was able to explore and hone in on the landscape surrounding Parton village to identify any interesting features.The fertile landscape around Loch Ken and the River Dee, which surround Parton was used in antiquity to cultivate crops; a pre-Improvement field system has been identified  and is depicted on the 1st edition Ordnance Survey Map of Kirkcudbright in1852 (Sheet 31).First Edition OS map (Kirkcudbright 1852, sheet 31) ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Within the vicinity of Parton village is the parish church built by Walter Newall in 1834. To the east of the parish church lie the ruins of its predecessor, a church said to have been built in 1592. The church was dedicated to St Inans, and so was known as Kilennan. The pulpit dated 1598 now resides in the National Museum of Antiquities.Directly to the south of the parish church is Kirkland Motte, a mound, probably artificial, rising from a slightly elevated plateau situated between Parton Village and the River Dee. Mottes are the surviving earthworks of timber castles, of which there was a high density in the Dumfries and Galloway region. There is a second of these medieval defensive structures to the west of Parton Village. The Motte at Boreland of Parton, formed from a natural rocky hillock, is situated in an angle of the Boreland Burn, which defends it on the north and east sides. An external rampart around the base of the hillock defends the south and west approaches.With the road through Parton funnelled between Glengunnoch Hill and Loch Ken, the two mottes may have had a role in controlling movement and passage along the valley of the Dee. This strategic position may have been of significance in a long period of contention between Galloway and the Kings of the Scots.Parton Village today is a charming row of terraced cottages within a rural landscape, as we have seen however this idyllic settlement is one borne out of a tumultuous past. Our past is our cultural heritage, and every place has a past, even this little row of cottages. This is what I find so fascinating about archaeology; the stories it can potentially uncover.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Lynsey Halliday (RCAHMS) – Dumfries and Galloway by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"197","Hi, I’m Sam, and I’m the Council of British Archaeology (CBA) funded Community Archaeology Training Placement based at the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust in Shropshire. I started my training post back in April this year and have so far been involved in a variety of events and activities that will hopefully provide me with the skills to work in community archaeology when my placement finishes in 2014.My average day usually always starts the same way, checking emails and messages, and responding to any enquiries that may have come in from volunteers, local societies, schools, or members of the community with an interest in archaeology. For example, on Saturday we’re running a taster session for the Young Archaeologists Club as part of the Festival of Archaeology, so this morning there were a handful of emails regarding that.Guiding a World War themed walk back in JuneOnce emails etc have been checked, my day can vary quite considerably, and I suppose that’s the beauty of working in community archaeology.  The variety of my work is essentially because my role here at Ironbridge is to engage the local community with the archaeology in the area. Sometimes this is a simple task, especially when people already have an interest in the subject, but at other times the target audience may not be able to jump in a trench and excavation to their hearts content, but this does not mean that they don’t want to be involved. Therefore we look to involve everyone by leading guided walks, running public lecture series and workshops, visiting local schools and holding regular volunteer sessions for people to become involved in projects such as finds recording, archiving, research and even some excavation.Volunteers working on a finds recording projectSo what does my day entail today? Emails have been checked, and so my attention can now turn to an upcoming volunteer project looking into the site of a china works based in the village of Madeley, just down the road from the museums offices. This will involve a small scale excavation planned for September, so I’m busy putting together the project design and most importantly making sure that we’ll have the right equipment and man power for the job. Then this afternoon, I’m going to be allowed out of the office and into the sunshine, to lead a guided walk around the sites associated with the ceramic industry in Jackfield and Coalport.At times, any job in archaeology can seem a little repetitive and mundane, but being able to work with people who have a genuine interest and love for the archaeology and heritage of this area does brighten up even the dullest of days. I am forever learning new things and finding new paths to explore, and I can safely say that I enjoy my job.The Inspiring a community in the heart of a World Heritage Site: Community Archaeology in the Ironbridge Gorge by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"198","Today is a special Day of Archaeology version of our Walbrook blog; welcome to all those new Day of Archaeology faces and old Walbrook friends!So we have fearlessly returned to the site! Like newborn foals, our pasty feeble arms and legs are coaxed into life after a few months of checking paperwork in the office. As we walk down onto site we realised a lot has changed… mainly the access. How the hell do we get down to the area now?We had two main things to do today: look at the section underneath the retaining wall in what was our main area of excavation, and say hello to the crew who are going to be digging the sewer heading.We headed down to our old area first. This took a lot longer than we think, not only because of the access issue noted before, but also because we couldn’t walk 10 meters without one of the McGee’s guys saying hello and asking how it is going. It’s nice to be loved! Although not everyone loves us, I am sure their were some steely eyes watching us from the contractors office, ready to pounce and mitigate in case we uttered the words ‘can I just take a look at that?’McGee’s love our friendly Canadian (c) MOLA 2013So for those of you that follow our blog about the excavation, you may remember we had two large open areas and a number of trenches, and in the largest area (20 sq m) we excavated a depth of about 8 m of archaeology. This ranged from Post-Medieval through to the earliest Roman inhabitants. Well after we had finished they cleared the area to a flat level (after all archaeologists never dig flat sites) and then built a large piling mat on top to enable the piling. For those of you who have ever wondered what one of those really tall machines are (that is not a crane) sticking out the top of site with what looks like a big screw attached, that’s a piling rig. And as we never do things by half on this site, we had the biggest one in Europe! It had to driven all the way over from Germany with its own German crew – this thing can drill some big holes!Anyway I digress… so today was the day they had finished removing the piling mat, and had dug the ground level down below the natural clay at which we stopped digging. Basically we are here to check the ground to make sure that it was only London clay that could be seen, and no earlier archaeology had appeared, or we had left any timbers in the ground (not that we don’t have enough timber anyway). So, as all archaeologists do when they walk up to a big hole that has been dug by a machine, we all held our breath whilst we went round the corner… and were greeted by a wall of London Clay. Nothing had appeared below the level we had excavated. Occasionally it is possible that very early layers of alluvial material may cover evidence of prehistoric activity, but in this case there was none.Sadie checking out the work (c) MOLA 2013This is how deep the site is now! See the abandoned orange mains breaker box on the 2nd row of steel? I remember just before Easter standing on the ground and plugging cables into that! (c) MOLA 2013So with the main area checked out, and more re-acquaintances made, we navigated our way across site to the sewer heading that would be our home for the next two weeks. By this time the heat has really caught up with us (I tell you we are out of shape) and the water in coolers that had been placed around site by the principle contractor are much appreciated.So the sewer heading: you never see TV archaeologists doing this (oh wait, Sadie you are a TV star…). Mike and myself had never encountered a sewer heading before and, after asking a few old hats in the office, had worked out that it is probably one of the more restricted environments you will find yourself in, not just for space but also for scope of recording any archaeology that comes up. Sadie did point out that they are fun, and that you get to crawl around in a new tunnel underground, which piqued our interests a bit more. Although within a few minutes of meeting the guys who were excavating the sewer heading I am not sure how much access we are going to get to it… they really were not convinced we had the correct confined spaces tickets to enter. It is good of them to challenge us, as after all the hole is their responsibility, but this really isn’t the kind of thing you try to blag your way into for a bit of a laugh. When we go down there we need a harness, breathing apparatus and a rescue plan, so although the idea of crawling underground may be fun, the reality is fairly dangerous should something happen. So we have got over the introductions and they realise we are serious; they let us have a look at what they had done… not a lot! It was going to take a while to break through the basement wall.Start of the sewer heading (c) MOLA 2013So maybe next week they may hit soil, and then we will be in the tunnel about 4m underneath one of London’s busiest roads, looking for more of the Pompeii of the north…But for the rest of the day it looks like it’s back to the office and more paperwork.The Jess Bryan (MOLA): Back to the Walbrook, sewer or later! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"199","Greetings from Thomson, Georgia, USA!We are thrilled to be participating in a Day of Archaeology! I am the Curator and Archaeologist of Hickory Hill, a historic site near Augusta, Georgia. On our 256 acres we have many archaeological sites. The one we have been working on since the summer of 2005 is the Jeffersonian Publishing Plant. All of the work is done by teenagers.In 1910, populist statesman Thomas Edward Watson constructed a large brick building on the grounds of his home where he published a weekly newspaper, a monthly magazine (with a readership of about 30,000 people), books, and pamphlets. The building was quite large with 3 printing presses, 2 linotype machines, and 30 employees! Unfortunately, in the 1920s the structure burned and the remainder was torn down.Since 2005, we have been excavating at the site, now designated 9MF914, with our summer archaeology camp. This is a day camp for kids age 11 to 18 who are interested in participating in real archaeology — no seeded sand pits here.The campers are trained in proper techniques as well as site preservation, mapping, and other necessary skills (Law of Superposition anyone). They spend the week excavating, screening, cleaning, and cataloging as any professionals would — and come back year after year to participate — not bad for rusty nails, bricks, and window glass. Who says kids are only interested in video games?!This summer our junior archaeologists uncovered a cache of discarded ink rollers. They were terribly excited and did a fantastic job recovering the artifacts. The kids couldn’t wait to clean them.  Among their other finds are are remnants of equipment, bricks, every sort of rusty nail, and lots and lots of window glass!They”ll be back next year.   So will we!  Keep digging! The Historical Archaeology with Teens by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

El poblado, habitado en la Edad del Hierro por el pueblo de los Celtici Supertamarici (los Celtas del norte del río Tambre) ofrece una perspectiva única para conocer el final de la II Edad del Hierro en la costa atlántica, muy poco conocida desde una perspectiva científica . Los dos castros excavados más próximos se encuentran a más de 60km de distancia.Parapeto sur del castroEl castro tiene un importante rol simbólico para la comunidad local, que identifica este lugar como la residencia de la famosa Reina Lupa, la figura mítica y pagana que permitirá a los discípulos del Apóstol Santiago enterrar el cuerpo del santo en el bosque sagrado de Libredón.Pero el proyecto del Castro de Mallou es especial por la atención que presta a la comunidad local y a la arqueología pública. Aunque el equipo arqueológico cuenta con ocho profesionales con experiencia en el trabajo de campo, el diseño de esta acción incentiva la participación de la comunidad local y de aquellas personas interesadas en la arqueología, a través de actividades adaptadas a las condiciones de formación, salud e intereses de los participantes en el proyecto. Se trata de involucrar a la sociedad en los procesos de construcción del conocimiento y de crear experiencias y estrategias para conseguir que sea la comunidad local la principal defensora y usuaria del sitio arqueológico.De esta manera, el proyecto ofrece actividades de limpieza, de asistencia a los arqueólogos o de antropología a los voluntarios, e incluso talleres literarios sobre como escribir relatos históricos. Más de sesenta voluntarios de la aldea de Mallou, de Carnota y de toda Galicia participan en el proyecto durante uno o más días, enriqueciendo la economía turística local y creando una nueva forma de relacionarse con el patrimonio.Conéctate en directo a partir de las 18:00 h. del  viernes 26 de julio.Live streaming video by UstreamThe Trabajar en el palacio de la Reina Lupa: el castro de Mallou (Carnota) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"201","The impressive location of the Mallou hilltop fort.An independent team of archaeologists, journalists, anthropologists and people from many different disciplines and professions is working on the last two weeks of July in the hillfort of Mallou, led by archaeologist Anton Malde and the popular science writer and university professor Manuel Gago. This is a public archeology project promoted by the  Council of Carnota.Main gates at Mallou hilltop fortThe hillfort of Mallou is a small fortified town on the Atlantic coast Galician striking monumental in its structures (especially the walls and the original door),  original configuration (a combination of large elongated structures near the wall and small circular huts in the center) and its excellent state of preservation, which allows understanding the original urban even without digging! The village, inhabited by Iron Age people of the Celtici Supertamarici  (the Celts located at North of the Tambre River) offers a unique perspective for the end of the Iron Age II on the Atlantic coast, very little known from a scientific point of view. The two closest excavated forts are more than 60km away.South WallsThe fort has an important symbolic role for the local community, which identifies this as the residence of the famous Queen Lupa (The Queen She-Wolf), the mythical pagan figure who allowed disciples of St. James burying the body of the saint in the sacred woods of Libredón.But the Mallou Castro Project is also special for the attention given to the local community and public archeology. Although the archaeological team has eight experienced professionals in the field, the design of this action encourages the participation of the local community and everyonge interested in archeology, through activities adapted to the conditions of training, health and interests of the participants in the project. The aim is involving society in the process of building knowledge and creating experiences and strategies for the local community to be the leading advocate and user of the archaeological site.Thus, the project offers volunteers a wide range of activities: since cleaning the dense fields, support archaeologist technical tasks, and even literary workshops on writing historical tales. Over sixty volunteers from Mallou villaje and allGalicia are involved in the project for one or more days, enriching the local tourist economy and creating a new way of relating to heritage.Connect live from 18:00 h.

"203","Alex Hale, RCAHMS Six places, in six kilometres, for six million people ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’.Imagine time travelling along the River Clyde from Erskine Bridge to Dumbarton Rock, from the 19th century to prehistory and back again. The sights, sounds and smells would be mind-blowing. Without Dr Who’s tardis or Captain James T Kirk’s Starship Enterprise we are a bit stuck in today. So what is it about time travel that makes us want to do it?Places from the past give us glimpses that we can enjoy, ignore, smell, touch and feel. But more than that, we can use places from the past to discover where we came from, make up stories about where we are going and look at the lives of people who have gone through similar and different experiences as us.Here are six places along the River Clyde, within six kilometres of each other and right on the doorsteps of six million people (roughly the population of Glasgow). From East to West along the River Clyde in West Dunbartonshire:Bowling Basin at the West end of the Forth and Clyde Canal -DP011643 (also see the Scottish Canals website)Bowling Harbour –SC124627 (harbour in 1927) and DP011642 (now in 2005). A vital harbour and ship-building yard, at the sea-canal interface.Dunglass Castle and memorial to Henry Bell, who built the first ever steam-driven vessel, the Comet – DP014231.

"204","Of course, most archaeologists will know exactly why they feel archaeology should be of interest to politicians: it provides vital information about human life in the past, in all of its fascinating complexity. This information in turn entertains and enriches us, giving a sense of perspective and depth to modern life, helping us to see and understand where we have all come from and the skills, struggles and mistakes it has taken to get the human species this far.But why should any of this be of any interest to those who are elected to represent the populace in the political arena? By its very nature, the job of an elected politician is to represent people’s interests, and there are many, many pressing interests which they are asked to represent. Some of these are local – planning disputes, resolving local conflicts, campaigning for greater resources for healthcare, childcare, schools, roads and rubbish collection. Other interests are wider and more strategic – representing their party’s interests, the slow grind of arguing for and implementing policy and, inevitably, doing things that might help them get elected the next time around too.I work for the Northern Ireland Assembly as Research Officer for culture and heritage. I see the intensely competing claims on the time of our local MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) first hand, and I often wonder if and how archaeology is of any relevance to them. I am an archaeologist by background; having spent time in commercial archaeology, then carrying out academic research in Britain, Ireland and in the Middle East, and then teaching, I found myself at the Council for British Archaeology with its headquarters in York. It was there that I first began to understand the crucial interface that exists between politicians and organisations like the CBA, and the crucial nature of the work that they do in representing and explaining the significance of archaeology at every twist and turn of legislative, policy or fiscal change to the Ministers and MPs who make significant decisions.Having moved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, I now support statutory committees by providing them with (hopefully) informative, objective papers and presentations on topics within my brief. I also support individual MLAs who often request research to support either their own internal party discussions, or sometimes constituency business. Starting here in 2010, I suddenly had to think about not just archaeology but also things like arts policy, sport, public libraries, and languages. What funding do each of these sub-topics get within the over-arching remit of ‘culture’? How are the policies pursued here different to the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain, or elsewhere in the EU? What could be tried here in Northern Ireland that has worked elsewhere? Is there evidence of problems within particular policy areas?These are the kinds of issues which come up regularly, but I am often surprised by how often archaeology and heritage come forward as important issues for MLAs. I have been asked, for example, for papers on the scale of undeposited archaeological archives from commercial projects, the role of cultural rights within museums, differences between the planning policies for the historic environment in each of the jurisdictions of the UK, metal detecting, the restoration of historic canals, and the quantity of Irish artefacts held outside Ireland. All of this work involves careful liaison with staff in the relevant departments here (the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of the Environment), but also in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in London, and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in Dublin. It also involves talking to those who are often the real experts on these topics: those working in the field, in NGOs and in voluntary organisations. What surprises me further about this work is that the relevance or legitimacy of archaeology alongside all of the other political issues which are around at any particular moment is rarely questioned. Some of the anxieties which I know that archaeological organisations can sometimes feel, like how to argue for resources and parliamentary time for archaeology in the midst of seemingly more urgent business, are almost never real issues for politicians. I have never heard it said that archaeology and heritage are less deserving of discussion or consideration than schools, hospitals or crime. Of course, there are different views on how such issues are to be funded or addressed, but heritage is recognised as being fundamentally important in contributing to community identity (something of real significance in Northern Ireland), but also as an economic driver for tourism and regeneration.So today I am working on a paper which examines the social impact of heritage: what role, for example, do museums, the historic environment, and community archaeology play in contributing to quality of life, or to alleviating social exclusion? There are lively debates around all of these issues and plenty of evaluations, strategies and assessments to plough through. I will be speaking to National Museums Northern Ireland, to the Northern Ireland Museums Council, to academics at the University of Ulster and, of course, doing plenty of reading, reading and more reading. The Assembly is in recess now so it’s a good time to tackle a complex topic and try to get to the bottom of it before the MLAs return to the Assembly in September.The Why Should Archaeology be of Interest to Politicians? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"206","RESCUE – The British Archaeological Trust has been campaigning for archaeology and archaeologists since 1972. Formed to highlight the impact on the nation’s archaeological heritage of the building boom of the late 1960s and 1970s, the Trust has sought to enlist support from professional archaeologists, those in the amateur and voluntary sectors and the wider public in campaigns to protect individual archaeological sites, urban and rural landscapes with archaeological and historical significance as well as museum collections and archaeological archives.RESCUE is, and has always been, entirely dependent on the financial support of its members and individual donors. It receives no state or institutional support other than grant-aid which is used to fund the publication of a variety of manuals, handbooks and other publications. These are mainly practical in nature and are designed to raise and maintain standards of practice in archaeology. The Trust is currently in the process of reviewing and revising its publication list; new editions of standard works will be available in the course of the next year together with a major new publication reviewing archaeology in Britain since 1972 and looking forward to future developments. A conference, coinciding with the AGM, is held annually in April and takes as its focus a different theme each year. Recent themes have included the role of consultants in commercial archaeology, the current crisis in archaeological archives and maritime archaeology. A newspaper, RESCUE News, appears three times a year and complements the Trust’s website, Facebook page and Twitter account.RESCUE is run by an all-volunteer elected Council who receive no financial remuneration for their work and who claim no travel or other expenses from the Trust. Administrative support is provided by our hard-working part-time, professional office manager. Four officers (Chair, Vice-chair, Treasurer and Secretary) are assisted by members of Council who take on roles related to their areas of specialisation and knowledge. Ex-officio members of the Council are responsible for the production of RESCUE News and the maintenance and updating of the website. Close relations are maintained with the United Kingdom Institute of Conservation (ICON) with whom the Trust publishes First Aid for Finds, the standard text for on-site and post-excavation conservation of archaeological finds.Members of the council review and comment on government and other proposals and initiatives which have an impact on archaeological sites and landscapes; RESCUE’s financial independence from the state and government means that we are free to offer radical and fundamental critiques of everything from the funding and structure of English Heritage to major infrastructure projects without compromise or concession to special interest groups or funding bodies. Although an active member of the umbrella groups The Heritage Alliance and The Archaeology Forum, and with good links to a wide variety of activist groups, RESCUE takes its independent role extremely seriously and does not compromise on its core commitment to defending the interests of archaeology and archaeologists against all threats.RESCUE is always in need of new members and new volunteers to serve on the Council but like many similar organisations, persuading individuals to support the work of the Trust is always difficult, particularly at times of financial stress although such times tend to produce the greatest threats to archaeology and the nation’s heritage more generally.Details of our recent campaigns, publication and membership can all be found on the RESCUE website You can also find us on Facebook: RESCUE – The British Archaeological Trust  and on Twitter @rescue_newsThe RESCUE: Campaigning for Archaeology & Archaeologists by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"207","Greeting from Rome and from the members of the 2013 Palatine East Pottery Project (PEPP).While everyone loves excavating and the thrill of new discoveries help fuel the impulse, fieldwork is only the first component of a newly discovered object’s life and the last destructive event of an artifact’s context.  The study, description and analysis, and final publication of archaeological material are important phases of archaeology.  It is often not glamorous or “on location” at the archaeological site, but relegated to storerooms and mundane-sounding finds processing. View of Sector B of the Palatine East Excavations (taken early 1990s)The Palatine East Excavations (1993-1999), direct by Dr. Eric Hostetter (professor emeritus, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) were the first systematic excavation of the northeast slope of the Palatine Hill in Rome, Italy.  The hill is one of Rome’s famed seven hills, the home to its emperors for hundreds of years, and the site of its earliest settlements.  The excavated materials which we are studying consist of a broad range of finds that include fresco fragments, terracotta sculpture, worked bone, lamps, and pottery.  This last class of material, pottery, consists of over 15 metric tons (ca. 15,000 kgs. or 33,000 lbs.) of broken pottery.  Since 1999, it has been the task of the Palatine East Pottery Project (PEPP), directed by J. Theodore Peña (University of California at Berkeley), and assisted by Dr. Janne Ikaheimo (Oulu University, Finland), and Dr. Victor Martinez (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and a host of archaeology graduate students (most recently Jennifer Black, U. Cal-Berkeley) and other student volunteers and apprentices (this year including Jason Greenwald and Angus Leydic, both from Duquesne University).Our storage space in the base of the Chiaraviglio apartments of the American Academy in Rome Dr. Victor Martinez (UNC-CH) fins a join among the many fragments of Calabrian wine amphorae (so-called form Keay 52s).The The Post-Excavation Experience by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"208","The Skills for the Future Trainees, RCAHMSClackmannanshire. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’As Collections Trainees we tend not to deal directly with archaeology in the conventional sense. We do, however, get to work with the archives created by archaeological units. We recently worked on the material created by the programme of excavations and buildings recordings for the Upper Forth Crossing in 2006 by Headland Archaeology Ltd. The Upper Forth Crossing is now known as the Clackmannanshire Bridge which links Falkirk to Clackmannanshire.A typical archaeological archive consists of items such as photographs, slides, drawings, reports and site notes. Before cataloguing the Upper Forth Crossing material deposited at RCAHMS we organised the archive into order by project and area. We then worked our way through the deposited material separating the different types of media and re-housing it.Copyright RCAHMS by K Russell, Collections Trainee.Copyright RCAHMS by L Rogers, Collections Trainee.      While doing this we also read through some of the reports and site notes to get more information on the projects to add to the catalogue entries and to get a better understanding of the excavations for the crossing. We found the investigations into the remains of Garlet House, Kilbagie were particularly interesting.Garlet House was a 17th century house for a local Laird which had been demolished in 1964. Looking through the photographs in the archive we could see the progress of the excavations. Before the excavation the site looked like an overgrown field, but very quickly the house was uncovered.© Headland Archaeology Ltd (UFC05-GLT001a)As the dig progressed some of the features of the house became visible again.Copyright Headland Archaeology Ltd (100_0043)Copyright Headland Archaeology Ltd (100_0043.)      To find out more about the site we looked up the site record for Garlet House on Canmore and we were able to see some of the images of the house prior to demolition and compare them to the photographs taken on the excavation in 2006.Copyright Headland Archaeology Ltd (100_0041.)Garlet House in the 1940’s Copyright RCAHMS (SC1167941)      Through the archaeological archive and the images and plans held at RCAHMS we were able to get a sense of the development of the site from its original design to alterations through the years, even after its demolition.If you would like to find out more about the collections held on Canmore or the Skills for the Future programme visit our blog or Twitter @SkillsRCAHMS. This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Kayleigh Russell and Louise Rogers (RCAHMS) – Clackmannanshire by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"209","Have you ever seen, on TV or on the Web, videos about archaeology, leaving aside documentaries?Probably not if you live in Italy.Have you ever seen an archaeologist recording with a camera?Probably not if you live in Italy.I’m an Italian archaeologist and when I don’t dig I edit videos recorded during the excavation (when I’m too tired for studying…).I’m also a video-narration/storytelling enthusiast, and these two interests mixed together led me to produce footage like this, a docudrama that performs the 2011 excavation season in the Roman site of Vignale (Italy).My archaeological life so far has been a mix of university studies, excavations and recording videos. But communicating fieldwork is my favorite activity and I like to do it via video, especially referring to the point of view of the archaeologists, translated in a story using the genre of docudrama. Putting together images and sounds/voices, in my opinion video is the best medium for telling histories of archaeology, from the most famous to the worst preserved site. I think video can become a fundamental way of communication and involvement, raising public awareness of archaeological fieldwork.This summer seems to be not so different from the others, even if more satisfactory until now. In June, Giuliano De Felice and I won the first Italian video contest about archaeology, organized by Mappa Project, with this short video about Open Access in archaeology (not subtitled yet). It has been absolutely terrific winning this contest with a dialogue instead of the usual 3D models or documentary.Later on, I’ve started a new column about video-narration in archaeology on “Archeologia tardoantica e medievale a Siena” Facebook page. Every week I review one or two videos from all over the world that are characterized by a special care about narration; from this derives the name of the column “Making archaeology as a movie“.Today archaeology covers a wide variety of works and specialisms. Video-communication is not among the most popular at all and sometimes I feel I’m doing it for myself and a few other people (and always gratis!). But this doesn’t mean that is less important and less necessary. It’s part of the archaeological process and I’m going on doing it, trying to achieve a better and more involving communication of the fieldwork.I will spend my Day of Archaeology 2013 at home, editing videos but most of all studying boring books. Therefore I’m impatiently waiting for the new excavation season in Vignale, next September, when I can experience something new about video during fieldwork and resume the dig. This is definitely my favorite way for celebrating a great Day of Archaeology.The The Curious Loneliness of the Director of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"210","Nine months ago I tested my adventurous side and accepted a full time position within the Archaeological Studies Program at the University of the Philippines (http://asp.upd.edu.ph/ ).  I had just finished my PhD at Queen’s University Belfast. I knew it was a gamble….but…..it has turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. Here’s a snapshot of a typical day as the newest recruit to the full time faculty of ASP.Me! Happy Digging in Manila06.00am – 11.30amFriday morning kicks off at home with a coffee and Skype session to the UK around 6.30 am. A quick check I have everything I might need for the day (including a huge umbrella, it’s the rainy season here!) and I head out into the Manila morning. I love the short walk through my local neighbourhood, it’s always bustling with life, and everyone says ‘Good morning’ as you pass by. Arriving at the main road, I flag down a jeepney to take me to Philcoa. I love taking jeeps; they’re great, as long as you remember to hold on! Today I need to stop at Philcoa and visit the cake shop (more on cake later). From Philcoa, it’s another jeepney ride to take me from the frantic traffic of Quezon City into the oasis of the Diliman Campus. Stopping for cake means I’m cutting it fine – just time to stop in the lecture room to say good morning to the early students and turn on the air con, before depositing the cake in the administration office fridge. A quick dash back to the lecture theatre, it’s bang on 08.30 am and I’m good to go! I take two Undergraduate classes for the module, ‘Archaeological Heritage: The Past is Not a Foreign Land’. This is an introduction of Archaeology course and is great fun to teach because you can cover all manner of interesting topics. Today was focused on the discovery of ‘The King in the Carpark, Richard III’ by Leicester University. The classes run back to back, so I will be teaching until 11.30 am.The home of ASP11.30 am – 3.30pm: Class is over, so it’s time for lunch (we eat early here). I’m eating in my room today, working lunch for me while I check e-mails. So far so good; I’m confirmed to present a paper at the IPPA’s 2014 in Cambodia and will meet with some colleagues from another department to discuss a forensic project next Monday. The rest of this particular afternoon is dedicated to grading Undergraduate papers and finishing up a chapter for a book. I also spend some time drafting a check list of tasks for a rescue project I am supervising in Manila. This particular project involves the recovery and recording of a large quantity of human remains which were discovered, quite unexpectedly, by workers on a church restoration project. We have a small team of excellent human osteology students on site cleaning and recording the bone, and it’s a great opportunity for my graduate students to get hands on experience with the identification of fragmentary remains.Inspecting skeletal remains in Manila  3.30 pm – 5.00pm: Fancy Friday! MeriendaI stole the title ‘Fancy Friday’ from my old office mates back in Belfast. Basically, it means it’s Friday, let’s have cake. It’s a great way to get everyone out of their office and into one place to chat. Also, I love any excuse to eat cake in the Philippines, they taste so much better than in the UK…I wonder if it’s connected to the humidity….anyway, the remaining time until 5pm is spent organising paperwork for a generous research grant I am being awarded by the University of the Philippines. This will allow me to head up my own project, conducting research into the taphonomy of human bone in Island Southeast Asia. The Director of ASP, Dr Armand MijaresASP Masters students grab some cake!5.00 pm – Beer o’clock. Monday to Thursday, I usually work quite late, but on Fridays most of the faculty go to the near-by watering hole to unwind after a long week. Inevitably, we while away the next few hours discussing our projects and plans over some cold beers. This evening, I imagine, will focus on next week’s conference on Heritage and Prehistory being held in Puerto Princessa, Palawan, Philippines; organised by one of our PhD students.

"211","Natasha Powers: Head of Osteology and Research CoordinatorIt’s tricky trying to balance the pressures of commercial archaeology with fulfilling the research potential of an assemblage and presenting that to the public, but I like a challenge and I’m lucky enough to have a job that lets me do all of these things.At the moment I am writing the assessment of a rather interesting assemblage of 30 urned Romano-British cremations from Surrey (including one nice complete subadult). This involved lots of weighing; me getting excited about finding sexually dimorphic bits of bone, unfused epiphyses and the odd bit of pathology; and the polite incomprehension of my finds colleagues (who I share a bay with) as to why it is exciting to find a burial where most of the vertebrae are still complete. Mind you these are the same people who just announced that they’d got another Roman phallus “to add to my collection” – not quite sure what they meant by that!? Things got a bit interrupted by two forensic visits (we do a lot of bone ID for the Met and City police) and a walrus…best not ask…Analysing human remains and managing what you might think of as the environmental archaeology team is one half of my job (well 4/5ths to be precise). In the other fifth I’m trying to match some of the excellent ideas we all have for synthetic and spin-off projects to people who might fund them and to academic departments and commercial organisations who might be interested in collaborating. Coordinating our research applications I’m learning about all sorts of topics and periods that I have not previously studied (or in some cases chose to actively avoid!) from Roman tile manufacture to maritime archaeology via ginger beer bottles, WW1 housing and GIS mapping of finds distribution.On the research front, this week has been a bit more hectic than normal as we’re also finishing off a project which we’ve been working on with the University of Bradford and the Royal College of Surgeons. It’s taken my colleagues Mike and Don the past year and a half, but they’ve now laser scanned all of the ‘best’ pathological bone in our collections and come the autumn anyone who wants to (and can get on-line) will be able to look at 3D photorealistic models of some rare and diagnostic bones. Best send out that final invoice now I think of it…then back to putting the final touches to a talk for an afternoon on a boat on the Regents Canal (worse gigs than pootling along at 4mph talking about things that interest you). I’m drawing together osteological things to do with water and death, from prehistory to the 1850s… I just need to borrow the Archbishop’s false teeth and I think we’re set…The Natasha Powers (MOLA): Head of Osteology and Research Coordinator by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I work in the Scheduling, Marine and Battlefields team within Historic Scotland, and am responsible for operational management of the Scheduling programme, and leadership of Historic Scotland’s work in protecting and managing marine archaeological heritage, in particular through designation of Historic Marine Protected Areas.As befits the interests of a maritime archaeologist, I have chosen a shipwreck!  The wreck of what we believe was a small oared warship belonging to the Marquis of Argyll, the Swan, was lost at the S entrance to the Sound of Mull during an attack on Duart Castle by Cromwellian forces in September 1653.The Swan was discovered by a Royal Navy diver around 1979, who brought it to the attention of the University of St Andrews. The site is a particular favourite of mine as I took part in the investigations of the wreck which took place between 1991 and 2003, led by Dr Colin Martin.   The excavations revealed the well-preserved structure of a wooden vessel, including the collapsed stern, comprising the bottom part of the rudder, sternpost and associated components detached from the keel; the lower hull, comprising frames, inner and outer planking, and mast-step; and the less well-preserved remains of the collapsed bow.The team also discovered a wide range of artefacts, including carved decorative features from the ship, rigging, small arms and one small cannon with carriage, silver coinage, ceramics, navigational equipment, galley remains, personal effects, the bones of one human being, as well as plant, animal and fish remains.Wooden carved cherub in situ at the wreck off Duart Point, by the Archaeological Diving Unit (ADU) Copyright RCAHMS (SC1127028)Today, divers are welcome to visit this site and see guns and anchors on the seabed, but the remaining sections of the hull are protected under sandbags and sediment that are helping to stabilise the environment around the wreck.  As the site is legally protected, visitors must not disturb the wreck or remove artefacts without permission. Educational tours are organised through the nearby Lochaline Dive Centre, but if you’re not a diver, you can still enjoy a visit to Duart Castle where you will find an exhibition about the wreck. There is also an interpretation panel on the promontory next to the site.What interests me most about the Swan is that it shows that Scotland’s underwater heritage can be just as rich and significant as our heritage on land. With the aid of scuba equipment and the traditional skills of the archaeologist, underwater archaeology can contribute just as much to our knowledge of the past as the very best archaeological investigations on land.The online record for the Swan held at RCAHMS, was recently upgraded as part of a partnership between RCAHMS and Historic Scotland, aimed to enhance and promote information on the marine historic environment.

"213","I’m a Project Archaeologist and one of the roles of a Project Archaeologist is to pick up the pieces when a colleague has to abandon a project.For the last decade I have been acting as Project Archaeologist for the Irish Concrete Federation which represents the Irish Concrete and quarrying industry. The role of the Project Archaeologist is to manage the archaeological process on behalf of a client at all stages of the development process. Generally the function of the Project Archaeologist is to advise the client on all aspects of the potential cultural heritage impacts of a project from design stage, through site identification and acquisition, the planning process, environmental impact assessment, planning conditions, excavation, post excavation and publication. In Ireland the functions of the Project Archaeologist are often formally stated in a Code of Practice agreed between a development organisation and the State. Codes of Practice have been agreed with a number of organisations such as the National Roads Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency, and Bord Gais Eireann.I like to think of the role of Project Archaeologist being similar to a film producer. The Project Archaeologist doesn’t direct the excavation but they are responsible for what comes before the excavation and for a lot of what comes after it. Like a film producer the Project Archaeologist can also be left to pick up the pieces if the Director can’t finish the project.ICF Code of PracticeThis year on my Day of Archaeology I’m driving to Co. Galway to collect the excavation archive from a colleague who is giving up archaeology and emigrating. Things were very different in 2008 when Michael, the man I am traveling to meet, won the contract to excavate the medieval Moated Site at Clonmelsh, Co. Carlow through competitive tender. The site at Clonmelsh was part of the manor of Grangeforth, which belonged to the Cistercian Abbey of Baltinglass that was founded by the King of Leinster Dermot Mac Murrough. The site had to be preserved by record in advance of a quarry extension, and all that remains of the site today is the excavation record which consists of the context and sample sheets, site notebooks, drawings, finds and samples. Clonmelsh under excavation in 2008In 2008, at the end of the Celtic Tiger boom, there were over a thousand licensed excavations carried out in Ireland and this was already a considerable reduction on previous years. But with the subsequent collapse of the Irish economy the number of archaeological investigations has been reducing each year and many consultancies like Michael’s have failed. The ultimate objective of any archaeological excavation is to produce a published report and the failure of his consultancy placed this process in doubt. With the support of the developer I worked with Michael and encouraged him to submit a proposal to the developer for the continuation of the post-excavation project. The developer agreed to fund the work and a certain amount of progress was made. But the situation in Ireland has continued to deteriorate and Michael has found it impossible to support his family. As a result he has been forced to quit archaeology, put his house on the market, sell his furniture and his car, and take his children out of school and emigrate in search of a sustainable future. It’s sad to see a colleague forced to abandon their career and  leave their home and start again from scratch. I wish Michael well for the future. I’m afraid he is not the first Irish archaeologist forced to emigrate and he probably won’t be the last, as tens of thousands of other Irish people have been forced to leave in recent years. Now I’m left with the excavation archive wondering what to do next. Clonmelsh site planI’m writing about this because it is sadly one of my main tasks this week but also because it represents the current reality of archaeology in Ireland. Irish archaeology has been blighted by economic failure, imposed austerity and the failure of the commercial archaeology model. Those of us who are left are trying to pick up the pieces, but the loss of collective knowledge and experience will never be made good. Many excavation archives generated during the boom years now sit in store rooms with no one now to write them up and bring them to publication. The National Museum has been working to acquire the finds and archives generated by consultancies during the boom so the data won’t be lost but the task is monumental, and is being carried out at a time of reducing staff and resources. Most of this material will simply remain stored away for years to come. I’m reasonably familiar with the site at Clonmelsh so, with the support of the developer, I’m going to have a go at finishing the report, but  the data from so many other sites may never see the light of day.I regularly write about archaeology and you read more of my blogs here.The Picking up the pieces by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"214","This is the second year Wiltshire Conservation Service has taken part in Day of Archaeology. This year I thought I’d blog about the work I’ve been doing on an amazing Bronze Age cist burial.The burial cist was excavated in August 2011and was located on Whitehorse Hill, northern Dartmoor, on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.   The work was carried out by archaeologists from the Historic Environment Projects Team, Cornwall Council, led by Andrew Jones, with assistance from English Heritage (EH) and Plymouth University specialists.The cist was first discovered over 10 years ago when what appeared to be its end stone fell out of the peat mound which had been concealing it.   Since that time the peat has slowly eroded away from the sides and the top of the peat mound and after several attempts to protect the cist, a Scheduled Monument, the decision was taken by the Dartmoor National Park Authority and English Heritage to excavate it in order to recover any surviving archaeological and environmental information before the site and its context were lost.  This was the first excavation of a Dartmoor cist for nearly one hundred years.During the late afternoon, three days into the excavation, the stones of the cist were dismantled and the large cover stone (measuring 0.8 x 0.6m) removed.  This revealed a burial deposit lying in situ on the base stone of the cist. Visible remains included bone fragments, a shale bead and what appeared to be hair or fur. Two sharpened wooden stakes were also discovered outside the cist, one lying horizontally against one of the side walls and the other still vertically placed into the peat against one of the end stones.Located within peat at 600m altitude on one of Dartmoor’s highest tors, the cist offered high potential for good preservation of any remaining contents. It was at this point that I was contacted to carry out a microexcavation of the cist – little did I know the extent of what would be found inside!The level of preservation inside the cist has been fantastic and the objects I have found have far exceeded all our expectations. The occupant of the grave was cremated and the bone wrapped inside an animal pelt. Grave goods include a woven band with tin rivets, a basketry bag containing a flint, two sets of wooden studs and nearly 200 shale, amber and tin beads. There is also an object made from leather and woven plant material which is so far proving to be a bit of a mystery. The craftsmanship that has gone into making these objects is pretty mindblowing and it is clear that their owner was someone of importance.The project team are gathering the results of analysis that has been carried out and we hope to be able to share the results later on this year. Of particular interest is DNA analysis of the pelt, which we hope will reveal the species of the animal skin used to wrap the cremation. Meanwhile, I have been working on the conservation of the objects which is still ongoing. Today I’ll be working on cleaning and consolidating the woven band and checking on the pelt, which is being dried under controlled conditions.The project has provided an opportunity not only to try and discover who the occupant of the grave might have been, but to also give a unique insight into life in the Early Bronze Age and I am extremely privileged to have been involved. The objects will be going on display at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in 2014 so check their website for more details www.plymouthmuseum.gov.uk. I’ll also be posting updates on Twitter @helenwcons and on our blog www.wshc.eu/blog.The project was jointly funded by the Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) and English Heritage, with contributions from a number of other local funders.The Uncovering the Mysteries of a Bronze Age Burial by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"215","I have been working in archaeology for almost 10 years now, since finishing my Masters at York University, and have been working as a Project Manager at MOLA for nearly 3 years. Today for me started very well when I realised I already had my hard hat, boots and vizi vest at home and not under my desk, so could proceed directly to my first site meeting of the day instead of coming into the office first.I visited a site in the City of London where were have just started doing a 5-trench evaluation in the basement of a bar. It’s so cool going into these old buildings, which have often been very recently vacated – you find all sorts of weird things in them. This one still had cocktail glasses on the bar and a huge box of un-pulled Christmas crackers on the floor. I met with the MOLA Senior Archaeologist who’s doing the fieldwork and delivered a (very basic) work mobile phone to her. We are always short of site mobiles and only got a spare one for this site four days into the project. The trench she has been working on has a big Roman quarry pit in it, immediately under the concrete basement slab, which is nice and just what we expected. The second trench (in the kitchen of the old bar) is proving slightly more problematic as they keep finding drains and ground beams, and also operating a 5-ton mini excavator in a basement room is quite hot and smelly!After the evaluation site, I walked to my next site, about ten minutes away, which is a large open area excavation. It’s the biggest project, in terms of size and value, that I have worked on, and I’m very excited to be project managing it. We started work there just over two weeks ago on a 14-week programme, and should have over 20 staff on site at the peak of the fieldwork. So far we have reduced the ground level by around 3m and found a series of post-medieval basement rooms, complete with vaulted roofs, brick floors, stone-lined drains, wine bottles, and even a graffitied brick.Brick graffiti (c) MOLA 2013We’ve got a great team down there at the moment, and they’ve been helped by our standing buildings team and brick specialist to try to date the building materials and work out the complicated phasing of the buildings. The walls seem to be a complete mish-mash of yellow stock brick, chalk blocks, red bricks, ragstone rubble, Tudor brickwork, everything.Today I was meeting with the City of London Archaeological Advisor to show her around the site, and she’ll now make weekly visits to the site throughout the duration of the programme. We’re expecting medieval and Roman deposits beneath the post-med basement slabs, so plenty to see in the next few months.

"218","This morning I’ll be working mainly on former RAF Coltishall, a World War Two and Cold War airfield, which closed in 2006 and which Norfolk County Council bought in 2013.  This currently takes up a lot of my time, and little did I expect when I started digging in 1970 that one day a) I’d be a County Archaeologist and b) that we’d have expanded the scope of our interest to include, for example, milestones and other roadside heritage assets, and buildings as recent as 1980 (another Cold War heritage asset, a rare DIY bunker just outside Norwich).  Anyway, I’m just about to make two calls.  The first to a conservator at the Imperial War Museum at Duxford (Cambs) to get some advice on how best to maintain and/or restore the huge military murals painted during the First Gulf War on the insides of the steel doors of Hangar 1.  Second to a local resident who turns out to have detailed knowledge of the site, including the World War Two E-pens, for Spitfires or Hurricanes, two of which are extant and one of which we have just cleared of ivy, undergrowth and weeks (through our Norfolk Monuments Management Project).  He also knows about our three Pickett-Hamilton forts, two of which were very recently relocated by the Airfield Research Group, hiding under the turf (and locations not known to anyone who I’ve met on site, some of whom have been there for decades and involved in its maintenance).  Also they are not visible on aerial photographs, which I would have expected.David Gurney, Historic Environment Manager (County Archaeologist), Norfolk County Council  The Day of Archaeology – Norfolk by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"219","Day of Archaeology offers a snapshot into the lives and daily work of archaeologists from various subdisciplines and regions. At Campus Archaeology, we have been participating in this event for the past two years (since its beginning), and are excited to once again be a part of it. You can read our 2011 post, A Day (or 2) in the Life of the Michigan State University Campus Archaeology Program, and our 2012 post, Excavating Michigan State University with the Campus Archaeology Program. For our Day of Archaeology 2013, we are sharing our favorite moments from the excavations and surveys we’ve completed this summer.Dr. Lynne Goldstein: This summer’s archaeology was a little different for me. In addition to the MSU Campus Archaeology Program that I direct, I also directed an archaeology field school project at the prehistoric Aztalan site in southern Wisconsin (blog posts can be found here). Both kinds of archaeology are exciting, but trying to keep track of both when they are in different places (and different states) is tricky. As you will read below, the CAP group found lots of things in the excavations that were done as large-scale construction proceeds across campus. A very exciting moment for me was when I discovered that all of the various University offices with which we work are finally understanding that what we do is important and must be accommodated. We no longer have to argue with folks about our presence. We still have to negotiate access and timing, but that is only because of construction deadlines. I am exceptionally pleased that CAP has come so far and has been so successful in such a relatively short period of time.Excavating at Aztalan was also very exciting and interesting. Aztalan is a palisaded village that dates to the Mississippian period (roughly AD 1000-1300), and is now a state park. We were looking at two different structures at the site, trying to figure out how they were used, and how the people at Aztalan modified their landscape. We found lots of artifacts and discovered that some of the assumptions that had been made about the site are not quite correct. See our blog posts for some details, and also visit Dan Seurer’s website that has wonderful pictures of our work.I would not recommend that people try and organize and direct two separate archaeological field projects in the same summer, but we had wonderful crews, and with a lot of help, we were successful in both projects. Sometimes people tell me that they cannot get excited about “historic archaeology” or “prehistoric archaeology,” but I have never quite understood those views. Archaeology is always exciting – you are the first person to see, touch, brush, move some object that has not been touched in many hundreds or thousands of years – how can that NOT be exciting? Below is a shot of the Aztalan crew – we had an awful lot of rain this summer!!Katy working on cleaning up the trench with the plaster floor from Saints’ Rest Katy Meyers: I really love working with Campus Archaeology, so it is difficult to select a favorite moment. This summer we’ve made a lot of great finds, surveyed a variety of areas, and had an amazing team to do it all with. One of the days that sticks out most for me was when we were excavating a trench within Saints’ Rest. We had been digging the same 3 by 1 meter area for two days and had found hundreds of bricks and mortar. It was extremely difficult and very slow work. We weren’t sure if we should continue, but I decided that we should press on. At the end of the second day we were well rewarded for our patience. Almost 1 meter deep, we found a plaster floor, portions of an intact brick wall, a stove oven door, all the hardware for a door, and a clear division within the trench between the raised hallway and sand floor basement. The best part of it all was probably that the team working with me on this feature was so dedicated to finishing it before the day ended that we all stayed a few hours past ‘quitting time’. It was fantastic to be rewarded for our hard work, and this feature adds to our understanding of Saints Rest.   Katie working on a trench near Saints’ Rest, via Katy Meyers Katie Scharra: This summer has been a whirlwind of construction monitoring, digging, and labwork.  It is hard to choose a favorite moment.  Having been a dedicated lab rat for almost all my archaeological career, I have to say my very favorite moments had to do with the analysis phase of surveys and excavations.  Of all the artifacts, one in particular struck my interest.  A small centimeter sherd of ironstone that  was a small portion of a maker’s mark.  Maker’s marks are found on the underside of ceramics; like trademarks they can tell you a lot about who, where, and when the item originated from.  This allowed us to have an engaging and successful session of identification. To identify this marker’s mark, we had to first figure out its correct orientation.  Once that was done we noticed that there was the paw and mane of a lion.  To indentify this we utilized reference books on maker’s marks and Google images.  This allowed us to discover the company that produced the product was Royal Ironstone China, a company in England made up of multiple potters.  Further inquiry led to a match of potter and a subsequent dating of the artifact.  A blog post on the specifics of this search will be posted in the next few weeks. Josh cleaning up the chimney found at Saints Rest, via Katy MeyersJosh Schnell: This summer working with Campus Archaeology has taught me so much as this was my first actual archaeological field experience. One of the most memorable projects we did this summer was the dig at Saints Rest. The sidewalk construction crew was putting in a new sidewalk that happened to run straight through Saints Rest and we ended up putting two trenches in the area where they were going to be paving. The dig itself yielded a bunch of artifacts and gave us more information on the building, including the location of one of the chimneys. We pulled up a doorknob, some hinges, and a stove door from the trench located inside the building, and from the other trench I actually pulled up quite a few great artifacts. Aside from a large piece of Rockinghamware (a type of stoneware) from a shovel test pit near the trench, I pulled a spoon head out of the ground and later found the other half! We also found large portions of bottles, metal, and tons of glass and whiteware pieces. It was the longest dig we did this summer, but my own discoveries were what made this dig so memorable for me!   Bethany excavating the old road near MSU MuseumBethany Slon: My favorite part of working with Campus Archaeology this summer was definitely uncovering the old road outside of what is now the MSU museum.  Today, the north side of the MSU Museum has a sidewalk running roughly parallel to the building, with grassy lawn on either side.  However, in the late 19th century, this area looked completely different.  At this time, Williams Hall stood there instead of the MSU Museum (later to burn down in 1919).  We know from research at the MSU Archives that a road used to run on the north side of Williams, passing by the water fountain slightly to the east of Williams (the same water fountain that remains on campus today).  In May we opened up a trench just outside of the MSU Museum, and were excited to find a layer that was clearly the old road.  Architecture has always been one of my favorite aspects of archaeology, so finding this road and relating it to the old buildings and campus features was extremely enjoyable for me.The Day of Archaeology: Our Favorite Moments in Michigan State Campus Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"220","I am one of two HER Officers at West Yorkshire Historic Environment Record, which is hosted by the West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service (WYAAS). Historic Environment Records (HERs) are publicly accessible datasets that provide information and evidence about the historic environment in a particular area. They are an essential source of information for managing, caring for and understanding the historic environment and are (on the whole) maintained by local planning authorities, so they are used for planning and development control as well as for public benefit and educational use.At West Yorkshire we hold comprehensive records of archaeological sites, historic buildings and individual finds ranging from the early Palaeolithic to the Cold War and late-20th century. We are also the repository for commercial and local society fieldwork reports, and hold many other resources such as aerial photographic and slide collections, a range of historic mapping, and an extensive archaeological reference library.Checking e-mails with the first cuppa of the day at handThe first thing I do every day when I get into the office is check my emails for enquiries. Typically we get a wide range of enquiries – these can include data requests from commercial archaeological units to inform desk-based assessments for development projects; research questions from local societies or university students; or queries from members of the public who simply want to find out more about their property. We also have a bookable visitor space for anyone wanting to come and consult our records in person, and although we’ve not got any visitors in our search room today, this week we have had one person come in to look at records for historic sand mines, and another to examine our aerial photographs taken around the Wakefield area.Selection of aerial photographs viewed by one of our visitors this weekThe other main task in my job is to create new records, and to enhance the HER’s database. At the moment we are mainly concentrating on digitising our historic building records, which are currently only available in paper format here at our offices. As well as myself, our Assistant HER Officer and one long-term volunteer are working on this project, and today I have edited or created records for a 16th century timber-framed barn, a Georgian pub, a Victorian Baptist chapel, and a 1930s co-operative store. After we finish the building records we will switch our focus onto digitising our aerial photographic collections and colour slides.West Yorkshire HER database and linked GISAnother current concern and ongoing task is to increase the public profile of the HER. We have recently created a Facebook page and are using this to showcase selected sites or buildings that we have in our records, and share information about current archaeological projects and events happening in our region. The public response to this venture has already proven to be lively and encouraging, with the page attracting over 100 ‘likes’ and counting! In order to make our records more widely available to the general public we are also in the very final stages of putting our database online via the Heritage Gateway website, which should be up and running by August of this year.West Yorkshire HER’s Facebook pageAlthough aspects of working within an HER sometimes feel like never-ending tasks (there are always new discoveries and records to add!), I do often feel lucky as I get to learn about hundreds of fascinating archaeological sites and finds, and because it is such a reactive job, every day is often varied and it constantly expands and revises my own personal knowledge of archaeology. It also makes me happy to know that I have a job that, at its heart, attempts to have a positive effect on the community of West Yorkshire by highlighting and sharing the rich history of our landscape with as many people as possible!West Yorkshire HER’s Facebook PageWest Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service’s WebsiteHeritage Gateway WebsiteThe An Ordinary Day as a HERO: West Yorkshire Historic Environment Record by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"222","Angus. ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’Eve Boyle, RCAHMSA complex ancient landscape at Wheen, Glen ClovaMy name is Eve Boyle, and for over twenty years I have served as a field archaeologist with RCAHMS. This job has led me all over the country, identifying, mapping and describing visible remains of our ancestor’s homes, farms and fields. It comes as a surprise to many people (and sometimes ourselves too!) to learn that there are still many areas of the country, particularly in the Highlands, with an abundance of unrecognised and unrecorded sites. The Angus Glens, on the edge of the Cairngorms, is one area that still has archaeological riches awaiting discovery. As an illustration of this, I have chosen as my favourite site this small area of pasture at Wheen, straddling the public road running into Glen Clova.Prehistoric and later features at Wheen, Glen Clova, as mapped by RCAHMS in 1999, against modern vertical aerial photograph. South is at the top of the image. Licensed to: RCAHMS for PGA, through Next Perspectives ™We mapped all the sites you can see in the picture in 1999, but it was only in the previous year, when this aerial photo was taken, that we realised there was anything of significance to be recorded in the glen. The crisp low light on a November afternoon throws up long sharp shadows that cause the low banks and knee-high footings of stone walls to jump out at us, almost shouting ‘Here I am! Look at me!’The most exciting features are the prehistoric round houses, dating from the Bronze and Iron Ages. Three of these are clearly visible, one just left of centre in the foreground, another (which is oval rather than truly round) at the bottom right corner, the third in the middle distance, close to the right-hand edge of the frame. But there are others for the sharp eye to find. Our survey map shows seven round-houses in the area of the photo, with another six in the forestry and on the moorland to the north (the survey map has been turned to have south at the top to match the aerial photo). These are big structures, up to 50 feet across, the homes of farmers and herdsmen living in the glen two or even three thousand years ago. Around them the low light picks out small heaps of stone, now overgrown with grass and heather; these were formed as our ancestors threw into piles the stones dragged up by their ploughs.Oblique aerial view of prehistoric, medieval and later features at Wheen, Glen Clova. Taken from the north. Copyright RCAHMS (SC437236)But there are many other structures here – rectangular buildings occupied in more recent times, perhaps no more than three or four hundred years ago. The largest group of these, at the top of the photo, represents the remains of a farmstead from the 18th century, while the other small buildings (all shown in red on the survey map) were once perhaps the homes of labourers. The survey map also shows (in brown) short lengths of ruined walls and earthen banks, the remnants of a system of fields, some of which may be medieval or later, while others perhaps are as old as the round houses.This photo is a marvellous example of the great wealth of archaeology in our countryside, often no more than a stone-throw from roads we drive along every day.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.For further information you can also contact the local authority archaeologist.

"223","Things are very different one year on. This time last year, the History team at Caerleon was putting the finishing touches to a successful week long excavation, underneath the Iron Age Hillfort at Caerleon. It had been a wonderful excavation, with a perfect blend of highly experienced archaeologists, and complete first time novices – though by the end of proceedings we had established some new expert ditch diggers (though I don’t know how happy they were about it). Today, the planned excavation is a few weeks away, and the circumstances under which we are excavating are very different indeed, and for that to make sense, we need to go back in time a little.About ten years ago, Caerleon was a hot bed for archaeological activities. Those with good memories might recall the SCARAB group which used to operate out of Caerleon. Back then we did a lot of archaeology, a lot of great archaeology. But, for a series of quite boring reasons, most of which have long been forgotten, all that disappeared, almost overnight a great archaeology department vanished. A decade on, and I am very pleased to be able to announce, on this Day of Archaeology, that we are working very hard at Caerleon to bring archaeology back. As I write this, I know that I should really be working on the new degree proposals, but there will be time for that. Not just archaeology though, we are looking at delivering on Heritage, Archaeology and Historical Studies. It’s a long road to walk, but if this programme proves a success, we will be contributing to Days of Archaeology for many years to come, and that is something that really should be celebrated.For today though, it’s all about the comparatively more mundane process of pre-excavation prep. We’ll be spending most of the next two weeks finalising our team (and anyone reading this who might be interested, you’d be very welcome – see Excavate2013) and equipment. This year we are predominantly looking at a post medieval site, a series of farm buildings with some clear wall evidence surviving in places. In addition, there is one very tempting mound feature nearby. It’s never been touched before, and while it might end up being just a natural feature, or post med activity connected to the farm, it might, just might, be a Bronze Age feature – worth a look either way. We had a bit of a shock last week to hear that there were plans to demolish the tool shed and everything in it. A bit of a misunderstanding, which was quickly resolved, but those are the sorts of things that crop up from time to time, the least expected problems can be expected while preparing for an excavation. Rest assured, the tool shed and equipment are safe and sound, and ready to go into action in August.I’ve just had a symbolic unpacking of the trowel as well – a small but essential, and quite emotionally laden piece of kit. As we have officially been a History department in Caerleon for many years, the opportunities to excavate have not been as frequent as I might have liked, so my trowel of about fifteen years has a now annual recess, tucked away on the bookcase, where any who dare to touch it our quickly chastised and warned away from its proximity. That trowel has now made the symbolic move from bookcase to desk top – a daily reminder that we are getting closer to breaking ground.But that will be about as much as gets done on this particular Day of Archaeology. For all the excitement and rewards that field archaeology provides, there is that mundane trade-off, as planning, sorting and finding of tools that have been sitting dormant for eleven months, gradually come together. But come this time next year, I’m hoping that I’ll be complaining about the sheer volume of fieldwork facing us, after all, if all goes well, we will be, in part at least, an archaeology department once more.The Preparing for the Future – A New Day for Archaeology in Caerleon by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"224","Hi everyone! My name is Martin Lominy and I live in Montreal, Quebec (Canada). I’m an archaeologist, educator and craftsman. So here’s a slice of my day for DOA 2013.First grade student learning to prepare milkweed fibres.I work full-time in a craft museum as supervisor of educational services and part-time as an educator and craftsman in archaeology providing independent services through my business Aboriginal Technologies. On the one hand, my tasks at the museum are to plan, implement and manage the education department’s activities and projects, recruit, train and supervise the education staff and develop educational programmes, workshops and products for a variety of audiences. On the other hand, my work for Aboriginal Technologies consists in offering artefact reproductions, craft demonstrations and school workshops on the subject of archaeology.Reproductions of artefact fragments for archaeological dig simulation.My job at the museum is pretty much 9 am to 5 pm but that’s only the first part of my day. As soon as I get home, another job begins. After spending most of the day running around the museum trying to get too many things done, I gladly trade my computer and phone for an axe and crooked knife in the tranquility of my home workshop. Most of my workshop time is spent making artefact reproductions for museums, interpretation centres, universities, colleges and collectors. Thus my objective is to provide the public with a more pragmatic vision of the past and a better understanding of aboriginal cultures of North America through the experimentation of ancient technologies.Splitting a hickory log to make prehistoric bows.Since my reproductions are made with raw materials such as wood, bark, bone, antler, leather and stone, this evening will be spent preparing some of these materials for future projects which usually involves hacking, scraping, skinning, boiling and knapping. For instance, I harvested a large hickory log earlier this week after getting a call from a museum who had several trees on their land broken by a storm. I had already made a bow for them earlier this year so I picked up my tools along with a friend and headed out to collect one of their trees to make more bows. It seems most of my projects begin in the woods. Several hours and aches later, I had a tree in the car headed to my workshop. This wood will take several months to dry so it will be going in storage for future projects.When I need to learn something of scientific value I use proper period tools and techniques. The rest of the time I use what works best to meet client deadlines. I work beyond academic boundaries so I don’t consider myself an experimental archaeologist but rather an archaeologist experimenting to know first hand what he’s talking about when it comes to education.Drying salmon skins for fish glue experiments.This weekend is dedicated to completing a cattail mat for an aboriginal museum and a crooked knife for a survival instructor. So many projects and so little time. It doesn’t sound like much rest compared to my job at the museum but it’s a good kind of tired. I’m always looking forward to learning something new. That’s what I mean by archaeologist, educator and craftsman!To learn more about my work or contact me visit Aboriginal TechnologiesThe Some Kind of Archaeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"225","Well here it is..  the celebration of archaeology around the world.  I sip from my second cuppa and consider the enormity and diversity of what DoA actually is.  The real joy comes from reading about what others do, what they discover and how the day passes for those in the field or those in the office.    Exciting!Morning AllI woke to sun, which in Scotland seems to be a new fixture, and the muggy warmth of the garden is a moment of peace as it is time to get started for the day.    Here at BAJR - the day is both structured and unstructured simultaneously, with a list to try and chip away at, and a feeling that anything could happen as well.    This is an office bound day, with the memory of the last two weeks field school at Rampart Scotland, now a happy memory – though my aching bits remind me that archaeology in the field is a tough profession.  One task that must be completed soon is the transcription of the site records and the reorganisation of the files and finds, the samples and recordsheets into a form that can be analysed and written up.  -  Thank goodness for Murray Cook ( my coDirector) who is much better at the report writing!    But before then I have already made two drawing boards for Maggie (  my wife and the owner of Past Horizons ) -  she sits in the room today, trying to find another article while at the same time preparing for a rather exciting possible project later this year.Sunny side up. the Rampart Scotland fieldwork team close the last trenchStranger the request the betterOur joint mission as I stare at my list of things to do today,  is to come up with some ideas for a school/community project  input with artist Nicky Bird -  Nicky is an artist whose work investigates the contemporary relevance of found photographs, and hidden histories of specific sites, investigating how they remain resonant – The idea is to provide identity to mining communities that are being swamped by new houses and new people, trying to deliver archaeology that supports Nicky’s work and that of the Council.    What we need is a cottage or industrial building that young and old can dig – it does not matter that it will add nothing new to the greater history, what matters is that it allows dialogue and discussion between young and old, between old and new -  Maggie is following up a promising line – with the old colliery washing house – known as the Leaning Tower when it once stood over the town.    That is one project that will be fun!Cuppa Tea and impossible list – but on the bright side it is Day of ArchaeologyNow to the list!Well I often say archaeology is more than just a trowel in the hand ( mores the pity – at least you know where you are with the zen like act of troweling)  and I have prepared my list for the 26th July 2013 in order to try and push myself on to finishing or at least acknowledging the ‘things that must be done’.  On Monday I am back out into the field on a contract job – some 30 trenches to be dug, 20m x 1.2m wide  ah the joys of commercial archaeology, after the joy of research.  This is however the point, for me, the diversity of action that I spoke of -  Each day is exhausting and fresh, each day brings challenges and success, being BAJR means to me, responsibility with a smile.   So if you would be so kind, I will have another sip of tea and be onto an important part of teh day – the opening the emails, replying and seeing what news is out there in the world.  Time to check twitter, and facebook, to ponder BAJR Federation Forum and see if there is anything happening out there.   ‘Pon my soul!   Did you know it is Day of Archaeology today…     I better keep an eye on that! The Good Morning Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I’ve always been feeling lots of pressure because of the responsibility I have toward the project and the students I’m looking after (4 at the moment), and the language is also another great barrier which makes me struggle from time to time, but I’m holding the line…it’s worthy to hold the line as this is an unique experience for me, which I would have never had in Italy (my native country and also the country where I’ve studied for the past 6 years).I need to go back to my area on site, but let me say two more things before I do:1. Once you’ve joined this project you will always love it.2. If Calleva was a woman I would have married her instantly.Maybe one more thing, quite funny if you think that I’m Italian and I came from 1200 km away, like my anchestors did once in the mid first century A.D. We came here, we built the Roman street, and I excavated it completely, isn’t that hilarious? It seems that we do things and get rid of those things all on our own (obviously many other British students and non British students dug the street, yet it seems that there was this destiny already written: the Romans built the street and one of their heirs is excavating it).I wish you all the best and if you have a day off, why don’t you come and visit us on site? and maybe me?”KEITH: USA STUDENTKEITH (far left) and EDOARDO (2nd from right)“Archaeology isn’t just for professionals and students who want to become professionals:  I am simply an interested party who likes history and thought digging would be a fun way to spend my summer.  I know there is a plethora of people like me who see the dig as a hobby, and have come back ye ar after year.  Personally, I hope that I too can continue to learn from and participate in more digs in future summers.”ROSIE: 1ST YEAR ARCHAEOLOGY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTROSIE’S CERAMIC LINED HEARTH “For the last four days, I have spent my time excavating and recording a pottery-lined hearth, at the Roman site of Calleva Atrebatum (modern day Silchester), and what I have particularly enjoyed about this feature is that it has really given me an insight into understanding the everyday thought processes of past societies, which for a first time archaeologist, has especially helped at putting the archaeological record into context.  The feature, as it is clear now, had two functions, firstly as a pit and then as a hearth, which has been indicated the change in material and finds as I excavated. The pit, which consists of a single primary fill currently provides very little information of its function (waste or storage), and analysis of the removed material will provide more information on this. However, the material that is stratigraphically later, up until the top fill, provides clear evidence for the later change in function to a hearth, due to the nature of the material, which has also incidentally inferred at least two phases of use. The first fill indicates a clay-lined hearth, whether the burnt clay was intentionally deposited or has burnt in the hearth, it is unclear, but the layer of black fill containing charcoal above it, confirms its function as a hearth.The top fill above the layer of black fill is where it can be inferred that there is a second phase to the hearth, due to the pieces of broken pottery that have been deposited as a lining. It is unsure as to whether this is for the purpose of repairing or strengthening it, however the amount of pottery that has been excavated is incredible, including two large pieces of pot rim, which suggest that the pot fill is from the same pot. Except for the vast amount of pottery, there have been very few other finds, except an amazing piece of a stone cooking vessel, which at first sent the finds team into a bit of confusion as it did look like a piece of clay at first, however not only is it a beautiful piece, but it does help to confirm the hearth as a domestic hearth.Excavating the hearth, as small a feature as it is in the whole landscape of this Roman town, has been such a fun and interesting experience because it gave me an idea of how people used not only the landscape for domestic use, but also the material used to aide this process.”    JESSE: STUDENT VOLUNTEERJESSE“As a Canadian who studied classical archaeology I thought it would be difficult to get on-site experience after I graduated as Canada is not know for its wealth of Greco-Roman archaeology. But here at Silchester I’ve learned more more about practical excavation than I did during my undergraduate degree.Over the course of a normal day we are exposed to centuries worth of archaeology, from Iron Age long houses to Roman baths and even a couple Victorian gin bottles. Between more delicate work like planning or excavating small features and heavy mattocking of  two thousand year old cultivation deposits we gain a broad range of experience.Almost as important as the archaeology itself is the people we work with, some of the best excavators I’ve met in over six months of on-site experience. The connections we make here can last a lifetime. Through excavations like this you can learn about others all over the world.”HEN’S TEAMHen -  Supervisor – South East Area“I’ve worked at Silchester for 7 seasons now, working from volunteer through the ranks of staff, making some of my best friends in the process. Rain or shine I wouldn’t spend my summer holidays anywhere else.I supervise the training and excavation of an area of the site. I work with students, volunteers and staff members to ensure that the archaeology is removed in the correct manner and that the students and volunteers leave the field school trained up with the necessary skills. I see my role as the person who draws all the small things together into a coherent picture for that part of site, ensuring that all the paperwork and matrices are correct. I also support and encourage the diggers in their personal and professional growth (I hope)! A typical day at Silchester starts with a very large strong cup of coffee with some of the other staff. At quarter to 9 students, volunteers and staff start to gather on the side of the trench to await the days directions. This part of the day always feels very hectic as I need to ensure every person has something to do and that this is building their experience and skillset up. Once I have everyone set to their particular roles, planning, sampling, excavating, recording, cleaning etc I generally spend the day to-oing and fro-ing my desk where I try and catch up on paperwork to the trench where I sometimes feel I am spinning in circles as all the diggers shout my name to ask my opinion on their features!  A typical day will finish with a quiet half an hour once all the diggers are off site to try and catch up with my paperwork before dinner (and drinks usually).Some days can be quite challenging, when features seem complicated and it can feel like nothing is getting done, but other days there is so much progress made on site I can’t quite keep up.”JORDYN: STUDENT EXCAVATORJORDYN“My name is Jordyn Heimbigner and I am a student from the USA, working for 6 weeks in the field at Silchester! Silchester has been the ideal place to gain experience in archaeology for me. Each day I find myself both excavating and recording. As a result I witness a large part of the process rather than just one area, as I would have at my University’s field school back home. Planning the features prior to excavation adjusts my eyes and I have heard that many field schools don’t allow you to record, so I feel privileged with the responsibility to take part in recording. Additionally my supervisors have taught me to recognize the stratigraphic relationships among the features. Because the features here are not obvious structures built up, but were timber buildings, my eyes have required much adjustment to see the features, which is the exact adjustment my eyes needed for the experience I would like to have for my future career. Though I didn’t expect it to be this warm during my visit to the UK, it has been a wonderful experience here, and I will definitely be returning, if possible, next year.”WILL: 1st year Archaeology undergraduate“I have attended the excavations at Insula IX for the past two seasons. From both seasons I have gained a lot. Many new friends have been made living in a field together has been a bonding experience from which I have lifetime friends.Many new skills have been gained and shall be gained in the next season. Archaeological skills are first and foremost and from my time at the project I have learnt to dig, record, analyse and interpret all of which shall contribute to my archaeological career. My team working skills have improved as this project requires us all to pull together as a team. The team are all supporting and willing to help making the project a place of learning and friendship. The team are all a credit to the project.Overall I would say that my time involved with the Insula IX town life project has been a life enriching experience I will never forget.”MARIA: 1st year ARCHAEOLOGY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTMARIA“During my time in Silchester I have learnt so much from digging and taking samples to planning a feature. I was really impressed as to how Archaeologists are able to interpret an archaeological feature only by looking  at the soil colour. During my four weeks at Silchester I enjoyed mostly planning and the talks provided by the University which were very informative. The excavation also allowed me to meet new people from different countries as well as make new friendships. In addition to that, everyone at the site was very friendly and ready to help which made my first excavation experience even better.”LUNA: 1st YEAR ARCHAEOLOGY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTLUNA (far left)“I am a first year Archaeology student from Reading University and the Silchester escavation is my first ever digging experience . Being a part of this excavation also means I have to camp on the site for a month. Camping is challenging because of the lack of facilities, however it is also rewarding because it is social and I can get to know other people with the same interests. My average working day on site can consist of cleaning a context, planning a new context,or mattocking; we also take on sometimes other responsibilities on site such as: helping to clean finds,helping to process samples for the science department and giving talks to visitors. After two weeks working on site I have found Silchester to be a very rewarding experience and I hope to return next year.” BABS: SILCHESTER VOLUNTEER“I have been a volunteer at Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum) for 12 years. What compels me to return each year is watching history unfold year on year 500 years from the Romans to the Iron Age.A typical day would consist of planning a feature eg. A floor or a pit the process could include taking soil samples such as XRF these are taken to look at elements in the soils such as metals etc.After the samples are taken and recorded the feature is removed by troweling, collecting any objects such as ceramics bone etc as you trowel. These processes are repeating again and again to unravel the history of that particular part of the site.”NATALIE’S TEAMMATT: TRAINEEMATT“My name is Matt Cano and I am a Trainee excavator employed at Silchester Roman Town. I have just completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Reading, and having worked on this site for 2  seasons as a student, I am now employed in a Trainee capacity. Here is an entry from my Dig Journal: I awoke this morning armed with powers yet unbeknown to me. I took control, as Natalie (supervisor) had a holiday and Flick (Assistant supervisor) was a Mortimer person so would arrive late. I assigned jobs for a good ten minutes before Flick got back. It was time to put a slot into the triangle of doom part of our area, as this has been just as complex as the eastern part of site. Me and Douglas did this, creating a rather paralellagram looking rectangular slot we went through a substantial chunk of orange gravel and came onto the underlying silt. As Flick then went to the office to work on the matrix I helped supervise for the whole day, between me and Hannah we managed to keep everybody ticking over well. Overall I think I did a good job giving good advice and sometimes being absolutely impotent, but it was an awesome experience and I felt like I was learning so much. Saturday evening was Heroes and Villains themed party night. So I put on my superman onesie and cape and had an awesome night.” JENNI’S TEAM SARAH: EXPERIENCED EXCAVATORToday my main task was to set up and excavate a 0.5m x 4m slot, across what is thought to be a large Victorian trench. Excavated by using a mattock and trowel, the slot produced ceramic building material (CBM), pottery, nails and a copper brooch pin, to a depth of 100mm.My other duties include helping and supervising others in the trench, mostly those in close proximity to myself. I am working within a 30m x 15m trench in Insula III, in the Roman town of Silchester. Each year the University of Reading excavates here for a season of 6 weeks. I began as a novice in 2010, and have returned every year since, currently under the title of ‘Experienced Excavator’. I enjoy myself thoroughly each time and hope to return next year.”MUBARIZ: 1st Year ARCHAEOLOGY UNDERGRADUATEMUBARIZ“Silchester has definitely provided me with the necessary skills needed to carry out any excavation anywhere in the world, for example, the concept and importance planning as well as section drawing. During my four weeks at the Roman site, I attended lots of lectures such about the different soil layers, Geoarchaeology and the Stratigraphic matrix which allowed me to think beyond what I see and to successfully link different contexts and situations with each other. Washing and sorting finds showed me what happens to them once they are found. The staff members were very friendly, supportive and looked after all my needs throughout.”VISITORS’ KABINROSS: VISITOR MANAGERROSS (left) and JOE So, how to describe a ‘day in the life’ of the Visitors Cabin at Silchester? The short answer is that we never really have a typical day. The variety, of people and activities, is something I consider a real bonus of being on the Visitor team here. And just as there’s no such thing as a typical day, there really isn’t a typical visitor either. At Silchester we are visited by individuals, smaller and larger groups, families, clubs and societies and school groups. So far this year we have had visitors ranging from Silchester and Reading to Tasmania and Texas. Some visitors make a special trip to see us whilst others stumble upon the excavation quite accidentally. We have many first time visitors but also lots of returning visitors checking on our progress from previous years, and it’s always nice to see a familiar face.There are some constants though. We are the face of the excavation, and as such have a dedicated Visitors Cabin, where our visitors can find more information, activity sheets for the children and a modest shop (a quick mention should be made here of our best-selling Roman Rubber Ducks!). OUR ROMAN RUBBER DUCKSEvery morning I open up the Cabin and set up for the day with the help of my brilliant Visitors team, Joe and Emily. I can then be found outside the Cabin, eating my chocolate croissant (a little bit of sugar in the morning goes a long way), checking my paperwork for what is happening that day and who is on Visitor Duty, and watching the trench slowly fill up with archaeologists before I open the gate.When a visitor arrives they are greeted by either myself as Visitor Manager or by one of my team. They are given a brief introduction to the site and offered a site tour by one of our undergraduate students on Visitor Duty. Visitor Duty is a key component of the University’s undergraduate student assessments for their time at Silchester. From there we like to leave it up to the visitors and their guide to determine how long a tour they would like. They can see all areas of excavation, and are free to chat to any of our diggers, Finds or Science teams. Everyone is happy to talk about what they are doing – we’re a pretty friendly bunch! The visitors always seem to love the tours, and often remark on the enthusiasm and knowledge of the students who guide them.On the Visitor team we are also responsible for providing and organising school visits during term time, special group visits, and our Open Days. Schools get a special programme that includes tours, a talk from our lovely Finds team, curriculum related activity sheets, the chance to plan and dig like an archaeologist in our special planning activity and mini excavation pit, and try out some Roman-related crafts. These visits are a particular favourite of mine, being a teacher and freelance education officer in ‘real life’, and you can’t beat the boisterous enthusiasm of between 30 and 81 children learning outside of the classroom!Open Days are also a massive part of the Visitor team’s season. Our first Open Day this season was the 20th of July, and was a great success with over 700 visitors. We ran site tours by Mike and Amanda, and special children’s activities including the mini excavation pit, decorating a pot before smashing it and piecing it back together like an archaeologist, and the brilliant Story-time. The day resulted in lots of sales in the shop and donations, all of which helps to fund the excavation. Putting on an excavation like this every year is a massive undertaking so we are really grateful for anything people can afford to give. Our next Open Day is 3rd of August so do visit if you can!A particular highlight for me this year was helping to arrange a lovely after-hours visit by a local Brownie pack. I really enjoyed seeing some of them get to make their Promise on our lovely peaceful site, and was especially proud to be presented with my very own ‘Night at the Museum’ badge!So I hope you can see from this that in the Visitor Cabin no one day is ever the same, and we get a massive range of visitors to the site who all take away something different. At the end of every day I close the gate, and then my team and I pack up the Cabin once again until the next morning. After dinner I spend some time writing my student assessments for those on Duty that day, all the while reflecting on how lucky I am to spend the summer meeting all the wonderful and interesting people that visit us, at one of the most interesting archaeological sites and most beautiful parts of the country you can imagine.”SCIENCE@SILCHESTERCindy: Science MANAGERSCIENCE@SILCHESTER: left to right Zoe, Nellie, Cindy and PatriciaI start of my day with a cup of coffee…I survive on coffee during the season, and I am lucky enough to have power in my cabin and a kettle, so it’s the first port of call. It’s either me or Tom who sticks it on, and we drink it while listening to the radio, before the madness of the day starts.I start by bagging all of the dried heavy residue from flotation; emptying the trays ready for more sorted samples. When the students come along, we have a group discussion all about site formation processes and Science@Silchester…it’s a great way to get to know them and to try and remember all of their names, and teach them important aspects of archaeology and archaeological science. While I knatter away, the rest of my team are setting up and getting started on their tasks…flotation, sieving and sorting. We are a well-oiled machine at this point as we are in week 4 and everyone knows what they are doing. The day is then broken up by more coffee breaks, answering questions, sorting, and the occasional talk to members of the public, and the excitement of what my team may find in the samples…whether it be a seed or an iron age coin!It’s a great atmosphere and I have a fantastic team, and it’s been an amazing season so far…but we have a few more weeks to go. I look forward to every day, to spend time with my team and I wonder what we will find!Zoë:Science Placementhttp://archazoeology.wordpress.com“I awaken in a tent in a field on an often-deflated mattress and stay in it until the heat turns it into an unbearable Sweat Lodge of which I must escape from. From there I have my morning tea and toast (2 slices if I’m lucky, brown bread if I am luckier) then prep my body with all the sun lotion in the world before heading off to the Science Hut. Myself and the others set about prepping all the various areas of science, such as setting up buckets and sieves or putting out samples for people to sit in the sun and sort. Depending on the week, I may start by sieving through floated samples or floating whilst students get told about site formation, else I will be sorting through last year’s samples. It is the best place to be on a hot day- hands in the flotation tank or holding a hose, and teaching the students can be nice, if not a tad bit repetitive! As much as finding things like brooch pins, iron age coins and silver sheets are amazing, my favourite things are finding perfect complete small animal bones- they are so pretty!During lunch and tea break I relax with friends (of which I have made so many at Silchester, archaeologists are fun friends to have) then I will come back and switch back to the tasks in Science I have not done that day, if it is sorting it is nice to do something a bit less effort-inducing for the post-lunch period, though sorting can be awfully strenuous, especially if you have to pick out countless pieces of charcoal with a tweezer!After site is over (sometimes early because us pale Brits can’t cope with this crazy heat), I eat a usually decent dinner, relax with friends and then either party (it is hard to imagine an archaeologist without a can of cider/beer in their hand), wander the Roman walls of the site and star gaze or engage in games of Frisbee or pub quizzes before returning to my now freezing cold tent to cover myself in about 10 sleeping bags and a boyfriend.Being an environmental archaeologist might not be what one imagines of archaeologists working in a trench with trowels (I brought one with me, it is now an extra tent peg) but we find some darn brilliant things, and picking out a tiny, perfect seed from a heap of charcoal and knowing it, gives us some greater insight into what was eaten/grown/traded in those times is so rewarding.”Nellie: Science PlacementNellie (left), Zoe and Cindy“As a budding archaeologist there is nothing that beats waking up in a hot, airless tent racing to get dressed before suffocating. Yes, it does sound odd but the life lived next to the open excavation area cannot be beaten. The interesting combination of food served alongside the lack of proper showers and cold drinks is outweighed by the vast amount of archaeology and social activity that Silchester has to offer. And there really is something for everyone.Having been nervous about the idea of the science undertaken on site in my first year, it surprised me that it was one of the most enjoyable aspects of my time here. Thus, I sent off my application for a Science@Silchester placement and hey presto, here I am; and it hasn’t failed to disappoint. With the temperature reaching highs of 34 degrees Celsius the process of flotation and sieving in the shade with the added bonus of the use of a hose-pipe has been bliss. While many would argue that the process of breaking up bits of soil as mud to find gravel and organic remains sounds horrific-ly dull I can confirm that it is totally the opposite. The finding of several small finds has also been rather rewarding. The sorting side of things has certainly had its highs too with plenty of people to meet and old friends to catch up with. Indeed, the flotation tank seems to be gossip central. But nothing can beat the vast array of food and drink devoured in the science hut. Nicknamed cake Mecca in previous years, this year’s focus has turned to biscuits! A day is never complete without the fast sugar fixes gained at tea breaks.Never knowing what is going to be found is a significant driving force in archaeology as a whole, whether in the trench or elsewhere and the environmental sector has certainly produced some remarkable finds this year. But it is the social side of the dig that also plays a huge part in keeping morale high as the half-way point in the season brings with it colds and tiredness. There really is never a dull moment in a field in the middle of nowhere when 150+ students are pooled together! Events such as quizzes and ultimate Frisbee in the nearby amphitheatre bring out the competitive nature of many, with Silchester’s very own beer festival and pirate night (I’m not sure who is more scared – the local children being charged by a group of sword brandishing archaeologists dressed as pirates, or the archaeologists being bombarded and hacked at by toddlers with plastic swords!) providing more relaxed entertainment!Silchester would not be the same without the relaxed and friendly science team and despite not having picked up a trowel in weeks, time spent floating, sieving and sorting has been just as fun!”FINDSPHIL: FINDS TRAINEEPHIL“Each day in the finds cabin we receive the artefacts the archaeologists have found that day. We process the finds by washing, marking and sorting them ready for our specialists to inspect. This summer we have a number of interesting small finds, such as a Roman Seal Box and part of an inscription with the letters ‘BA’. These small finds can often tell us what activity occured in the town 2000 years ago. As Finds Trainees we also teach the students and volunteers that come to site in what they might find in the trench. In this way we can help ensure that they know what to look out for and how the record the finds accurately to build a better picture of the site.”Back to:AMANDA: Excavation DirectorThese are just a small selection of the people who make up the Silchester excavation ! So many people behind the scenes who help keep a research and training excavation like this running – from the man at the top, Professor Michael Fulford, to Jean our cook who makes 164 sandwiches a day, day in, day out to feed our hungry stomachs, to Jon my site manager who knows the recycling bins inside-out and who can recite the Reading-Mortimer train timetable in his sleep as he transports our daily commuters back and forth! I have 5 Supervisors, 5 Assistant Supervisors, a database manager – and my wonderful Jen who goes cross-eyed over the rotas she has to produce on a daily basis. Nick, my talented 2nd, keeps me on the straight and narrow archaeologically – and Dan who can level a plan with a glance, and is able to turn stratigraphic somersaults with ease. I cannot mention them all! But together we hope we are providing one of the most detailed and informative slices through a major Roman town – as well as learning the tricks of the archaeological trade to pass on to all those who come after us!TEAM SILCHESTEROver and Out Team Silchester!The Life in A Day: the Silchester ‘Town Life’ project by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"227","Today the team of the Digital Archaeology Lab (LAD) is joining the archaeological equipe on the site of Montecorvino (View torre di montecorvino in a larger map). The wonderful medieval site is located about 30 km west from Foggia, on the hills of the Apennines. Starting from 2006, an archaeological team of University of Foggia guided by prof. Pasquale Favia and prof.ssa Roberta Giuliani is working here to understand the sequence of the settlement. Since then, the LAD team realized several projects regarding Montecorvino site. First, the 3D survey of the tower has been carried out using laser scanner and photo modeling. More recently we started the project of a wide reconstructive 3D model of the tower and the whole site (see bottom of the post …). During last months the students of Digital Archaeology realized several 3D models inspired to the tower for their exam.Today we are climbing on the site to see the results of the last campaign, meet the guys that are digging for their last week of work before summer holidays, and take some shots that will be used in the final reconstruction.Spend with us your Day Of Archaeology 2013!1. Up to the hill …Giuliano, Lorenzo and Cristiano (right to left) today are leaving the lab to breath some fresh air (normally they prefer to spend most of their time in a wonderful electrostatic atmosphere, surrounded by the whine of the computers …). Andrea is already on the site to carry out the graphic documentation.After driving for half an hour we finally reach the base of the hill of Montecorvino and we park in a fuel station (clearly inspired by Steven Spielberg’s Duel …). You can see the tower on the background.The road to the hill is not paved and very steep. We need a special car to reach the site.Andrea is ready to take us to the top of the hill.Andrea arrives to take us and warns us: climbing to the top of the hill is not as easy as you can imagine …40 seconds at full speed:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-LzA5I4mwg 2. Here we are!It’s really hot on the top of the hill (about 36C), but a sweet wind helps. When we arrived, we found the archaeologists engaged in their usual activities.Digging, of course (and, of course, chatting …) Digging (again and again) …Writing their “poems from earth” …Using the most advanced technologies …Resting (just a little bit)Keeping everything in order …Because every single fragment of ceramic can be essential to understand …And so every single stone …And if a beautiful picture is worth a life …… nothing is so relaxing as using total station for graphic documentationAt least after you carry all the instruments to the station point! There’s still a bit of time to visit the ruins of the church to plan the 3D reconstruction, and our day on Montecorvino site is over.  3.

"228","Aberdeenshire ‘Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2011’I’m Iain Fraser. I work at RCAHMS as the Cataloguing Programme Manager, documenting our collections of archaeological and architectural archives so that they are available for public consultation.Vertical aerial photograph of the meadows at Baluss, Longisde, 1988, showing the pattern of rigs and drains. Copyright NCAP        My chosen site is an inconspicuous one, the need for which is perhaps not immediately obvious under Scotland’s cloudy skies. The site is an area of water meadows, near Old Deer and Longside, in Aberdeenshire. From any distance at ground level these look relatively featureless, an unremarkable expanse of low-lying coarse grass blending into the surrounding country. Standing on top of them, however, the meadows are revealed as low rigs, separated by reed-choked drains. Every now and again one encounters stone pillars set into the drains – slotted for now vanished wooden sluice gates. The slotted stone pillar of a sluice gate to control the flow of water over the meadow. Copyright Iain FraserSeen from the air, all these features resolve themselves into a complex of skillfully shaped and engineered blocks of rigs and drains running along the low ground on both sides of the River Ugie. With the help of historical maps, field-walking, and contemporary accounts, one can piece the process together. Upstream a wear, now breached, diverted the water of the Ugie into a lade, running along the upper side of the meadows. A series of small sluices, or hatches, then allowed the farmer to release the water of selected areas of meadow, as he required. The water was distributed across the area of the meadow by narrow feeders that ran along the crest of each rig, from which the water would then gently overflow across the sloping grassy surface of the rigs. The intervening drains would then carry the water away, either directly back to the river, or else to a second, lower, section of meadow.Two simple bridges at Mavisbank constructed of granite sleepers, providing access over the drains to the rigs. Copyright Iain FraserAlthough the use of irrigation had a long history in Scotland, the agricultural improvements of the period 1790-c.1840 saw a renewed interest in the subject, inspired by the highly successful water meadows of southern England. Several highly skilled English practitioners were engaged by Scottish landowners to construct meadows on their estates. The meadows at Mavisbank, Baluss and Inverquhomery, shown here, are part of  a series of some 90 acres constructed by the English ‘flooder’ John Bolton along both the South Ugie, for James Ferguson of Pitfour.Aerial photograph of meadows at Mavisbank. Copyright NCAPAerial photograph of meadows at Inverquhomery. Copyright NCAP        The meadows appeal to me as an overlooked and largely forgotten aspect of Scottish agricultural history. Easily dismissed by the casual observer as simple drains in an area of wet ground, with a bit of detective work, and having ‘got your eye in’, meadows emerge as a distinctive and intriguing element of the Scottish landscape.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology.For further information you can also contact the local authority archaeologist.

"229","Our team, from the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, Sudan together with the British Museum, UK  have been excavating in the Berber-Abidiya region of Sudan at Dangeil since 2000.  Excavations have revealed a previously unknown temple of the 1st century AD dedicated to Amun, the Nubian Kushite god of kingship. A number of surprising discoveries have been made there foremost being the find of fragments of four royal statues of  the 7th century BC which were found mixed together in the destruction phase of the later Amun temple. These possibly originated in a statue cache and included a large, striding granite figure of Taharqo, who ruled Egypt as a pharaoh of the 25th Dynasty, and two of his successors Senkamanisken and possibly Aspelta who is shown here in the image. Until very recently, it has been difficult to live broadcast/tweet/blog/etc. results of our excavations while working in the field. Electricity, mobile phones and the internet are recent arrivals to the area. Normally we excavate in the autumn when temperatures in northern Sudan are a bit cooler.  To get a flavour of our work, just in time for the Day of Archaeology, and with the fantastic assistance of the Web Team at the British Museum, our project web site, the product of many ‘days of archaeology’, has just gone live and highlights of our recent excavations at the site can now be shared more widely:http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/berber-abidiya_project.aspxThe Excavating in Sudan: Catch a Glimpse by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"230"," It's that time again! Third year of my #dayofarch posts... if you're dying to see how they've changed over the years, have a look at 2011 (augmented reality!) and 2012 ( i reveal myself to be the tooth fairy)...Really, I work at the Natural History Museum in London (and tweet at @brennawalks / blog at passiminpassing.co.uk ). And if you didn’t already know, I’m part of the collective Tumblr of awesome that is Trowelblazers ( @trowelblazers). We get all excited about inspirational female pioneers in the trowel-blazing arts So!Archaeology, huh? Life outdoors? Fresh air?Meh. Up to your hips in muddy water in February, more like it. That’s why I went and got myself a speciality….TEETH!Yes. I am a living, breathing example of the incredibly rare animal… the Dental Anthropologist. And yes, that’s a real thing.What do I do? Well… today, I’m hashing out some code that will preform a simple spatial analysis that will tell me about the distribution of different types of tissue on a thin section of a tooth.Before I could even get to this stage, however, there was a long and laborious process of making histological thin sections, digitally scanning histological slides, and then digitising lots of information from the tooth. But the end result will be that I will know to the day the ins and outs of someone’s childhood – growth faltering, chemical composition changes, and a host of other things that we can find out in the lab.So why teeth? A few reasons:1. Teeth don’t remodel. You grow ‘em once, and you’re stuck with them.With the rest of your skeleton, remodelling can hide traces of past events — if you broke your arm as a child, you might not ever know from looking at your adult skeleton. Whereas everything that happens to your teeth as they are growing is crystalised right at the moment, leaving an unedited record of the time when your teeth were developing.2. Teeth grow in a very regular pattern. Like tree rings. Because teeth are so regular, we know exactly which bits are forming when. So if something happens to a kid, like a bad fever or a period of starvation, that disrupts normal development, we can work out exactly when it happened. Take a look at these lines, left on a tooth from when the individual was so sick that growth stopped for a time. If we magnify it in a scanning electron microscope, we can work out how old the kid was in days when growth stopped: That’s fairly impressive for a kid who has been dead for almost 200 years!3. Everybody Teethes Almost everyone has teeth! Teeth usually survive really well in archaeological sites because they are heavily mineralised – sometimes they are the only part of a skeleton left. In my current work, I look at both the teeth from modern humans (super modern. Like, the subjects are still alive) and the teeth from children who died nearly ten thousand years ago a continent away in Central Anatolia.Actually, I’m gearing up now to leave for the field to go and take some casts of teeth of children who lived at the site of Aşıklı Höyük right when people were sorting out that whole ‘to-setttle-down-and-farm-or-not-to-settle-down-and-farm’ question. The casting itself is a funny process, normally used by dentists, but turns out archaeologists can adapt just about anything…The I, Dental Anthropologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Copyright RCAHMS (SC1314739)The Green is situated near Aberdeen’s harbour and is one of the oldest known parts of the city. Archaeological excavations of the area revealed flints, used to make tools for fishing and hunting, which date back to about 8000 years ago.In Medieval times it was in operation as an administrative and defensive point of entry to the city.  It also had a thriving religious community especially after the founding of the Carmelite Friary in 1273 when Carmelite friars settled here and made relationships with the local community.  Excavations were carried out in the 1980’s and 1990’s which revealed sections of the friary church foundations and areas where the friars would have lived.  Skeletons found through excavation are thought to have revealed the location of burials within the church and graveyard.  As you can see from the picture of Carmelite lane, below, the area has been completely built up over time and no physical remains of the church can be seen.Aberdeen, Market Street,View from South, showing Carmelite Lane. Copyright RCAHMS (SC1343754)RCAHMS hold a collection of ink and pencil drawings relating to small finds from the excavations which one of the curatorial trainees has just recently catalogued.  The drawings were used for the publication “Three Scottish Carmelite friaries: excavations at Aberdeen, Linlithgow and Perth 1980-1986”, Society of Antiquaries of Scotland monograph series no6 by J.A Stones which presents the results of excavations at similar friaries in Scotland.This site is a great example of finding archaeology in our cities.  Aberdeen City Council have set up The Green Townscape Heritage Initiative (THI) to tackle the problems of run down areas of historic significance and you can take part in The Green Trail,  a tour of areas of historical significance around the Green.  I would recommend paying a visit to the Green and while walking around just remember what was found beneath your feet and what may be found in the future.This is what I’ve chosen for Day of Archaeology, but why not tell us your favourite archaeological sites in Scotland on Twitter using #MyArchaeology. The Nikki Moran (RCAHMS) – Aberdeen by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"234","I often feel like I missed my true calling as an archaeologist. Despite being attracted to archaeology and ancient civilizations from an early age, I was dissuaded from a career in archaeology by teachers who warned me that there was no future in studying the past. It’s too late to turn back the clock but I haven’t let this deter me from pursuing my passion, albeit alongside a full-time job and other commitments.Much of my spare time is spent on reading books, blogs and articles on Chinese archaeology, ancient Egypt and Pre-Columbian civilizations or on writing new posts for my blog, The Archaeology of Tomb Raider, which looks at the artefacts, sites and cultures featured in the Tomb Raider video game series. Whilst Lara Croft’s exploits cannot be considered archaeology by any stretch of the imagination, I was surprised to find out that many Tomb Raider fans are actually interested in learning more about the historicity of the places and characters that appear in the games. This seemed like a perfect opportunity to combine my own personal interest in archaeology with my love of the Tomb Raider series and my passion for lifelong learning…and, thus, The Archaeology of Tomb Raider blog was born. Whoever said video games can’t be educational? I will be spend this year’s Day of Archaeology doing pretty much what I do every day: keeping up to date on the latest archaeological discoveries, sharing articles and educational resources on Twitter and Facebook, conducting background research for future blog posts (I’m currently reading up on Minoan art for an upcoming feature), working through a self-study course on Egyptian hieroglyphs, and networking with archaeologists and historians from around the world. Even though a career in archaeology will most likely remain an unfulfilled dream, it’s comforting to know that there are still many, many ways for me to fit archaeology into my life. I might not ever take part in a dig or discover some long-lost civilization but with so much to learn and think about in my spare time, I can’t really complain.Now, back to Minoan art…Kelly M Twitter: @TRArchaeologyThe Thoughts of an Aspiring Archaeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"235","In order to raise the students’ awareness of the relevance and importance of archaeology to the modern world in my course on Christian and Muslim archaeology, I pointed out to them, as I always do, the different quarters of Lower Haifa – the section of the city where much of the Israeli-Arab population resides. We strolled along the shabby Jaffa Street with its historical Ottoman (from the early 20th century) and Christian’s remains  until we reached its eastern reconstructed part with Jewish buildings from the 1930s.  I further showed them the eastern Muslim quarter to be soon abolished and replaced by high-rises, as well as a few selected reconstructed houses from the Ottoman period used as hotels  or office buildings.      Before raising a few questions, I also drew attention to the annual multi-ethnic cultural events called “the Holiday of Holidays.  This symbolic action organized by the municipality and taking place in the densely populated and segregated Arab quarter in Lower Haifa has contributed in part to upgrading the city’s status and boosting its economy. Recently, the multi-ethnic demographic character of Haifa (90% Jews: 10% Arab), has also been mentioned in a letter sent to president Obama by the mayor of Haifa inviting him to visit the city and witness the “over 100 years of ongoing dialogue” between its Arab and Jewish citizens.I, then, asked the students to express their opinions on the following questions:1-Is the selective reconstruction by the municipality, which puts emphasis on the past of the dominant majority (Jews) and obliterates extensive parts of the past of the minority (Arabs), in the name of modernization and gentrification processes reasonable?2 – Who should be the main beneficiary of the cultural events taking place in the segregated quarter inhabited solely by Arab citizens – the locals whose poor conditions of living should be ameliorated by the municipality, or the   dominant Jewish majority which resides in other parts of the city and appropriates the Palestinian heritage without acknowledging it?Most of the students who participated in the debate that followed my questions were in favor of the gentrification processes and modernization of downtown Haifa.  They thus consented to the municipality’s partial preservation of the Palestinian past.  Only two students considered also the welfare of the Arab citizens who resided in Lower Haifa.I was surprised by the student responses.  Not only does the majority of my class consist of students who belong to the minority community but from my acquaintance with other young Arabs I was expecting a different, more militant, reaction. I concluded that either the students felt uninterested to express their opinions in an Israeli academic institute with both Jews and Arabs participating in the class, or that I had failed to point out that both gentrification that neglected the urban infrastructure of parts of Lower Haifa and redevelopment efforts in other parts were selective and clearly differentiate between Arab and Jewish groups, in spite of some symbolic actions of the municipality toward the former.   The The Treasures of the Ottoman Era-Haifa by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"236","That’s me in a giant trench excavating for Campus Archaeology, found part of the first dormitoryThe Day of Archaeology is a digital celebration of the breadth and variety of archaeology that occurs throughout the world. It provides a snapshot of what different types of archaeologists do on a day to day basis. The goal is to increase “public awareness of the relevance and importance of archaeology to the modern world” (Day of Archaeology). I’ve participated in this event for the past two years, and I’m excited to be joining in again for my third year! I’m adding my perspective in two ways, the first is through my primary job as Campus Archaeologist of MSU. You can check out my Day of Archaeology post on Campus Archaeology here: Our Favorite Moments in Campus Archaeology which includes my favorite moment from digging this summer. Second, I can share what I’m doing on a daily basis.Early Morning: I always start the day with a flavored coffee, and my current favorite is Macadamia Nut Cookie coffee that I have to order special online. Once I get that first sip into my system, I read up on the archaeology news. It’s important to keep up to date on what has been found, what new techniques are being used, and what may potentially serve as a new blog post for Bones Don’t Lie. I’ve found that starting the day like this prepares my brain for work. This morning I’m caught looking up the effects of corsets on bones; an odd topic for breakfast, but oh so intriguing.Morning: I head into the office to start my job as Campus Archaeologist around 8am. The MSU Campus Archaeologist is a position held by a grad student, and involves running the day to day operations of the program including monitoring construction, excavating prior to construction, engaging with the campus community and conducting research on the archaeology of campus. It is a two year position, and I’ve been Campus Archaeologist for approximately 23 months. This means that my time today is going to be spent preparing for the new Campus Archaeologist. I’m hoping to get all of my reports finished before my predecessor begins. A quick break from writing to meet with the Chair of the Anthropology department to discuss my new job, and then I’m back to working on Campus Archaeology reports. We did about 6 archaeological surveys, so there is a lot of research and writing that needs to be done to complete the summer work.Afternoon: This afternoon I’m working on writing up my research trip. As many of my Bones Don’t Lie readers know, I’ve been in England examining archaeological collections and meeting with various archaeologists to prepare for my dissertation proposal. Every day over the two weeks abroad I visited a different museum or university. All of that information needs to be collated and written up before it leaves my brain. When I think about my life as an archaeologist, I mostly remember the days in the dirt. Realistically though I spend most of my time at my computer writing up what I’ve been doing or what I intend to do. Archaeology is a few months of digging bookended by months of careful research, interpretation and writing.Night: If it is a Monday or Wednesday night, that means I’m going to spend a couple hours researching and writing a new Bones Don’t Lie post. One of the things I love about writing a blog broadly on mortuary archaeology is that I get the chance to learn about a lot of different regions and time periods. Burial practices vary so much through time and space, and I love that I have a venue for sharing what I’ve learned about them. Tonight though, I’m doing something less scholarly because its Friday. I was inspired as a kid by Tomb Raider, and I still get a thrill playing archaeology themed video games. Admittedly, tonight I’m playing a grave robbing and completely not politically correct adventure game with archaeological undertones- Uncharted. These types of games allow me to feel something I only feel when digging- the sense of the unknown and the opportunity to uncover it. I’d rather be digging up a burial, learning who the skeleton inside was, and doing the hardcore research- but sometimes we need downtime, and games like these provide a quick fix for that desire.The A Day in the Life of Bones Don’t Lie by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"238","Kauttua village near the west coast of Finland, by the Eurajoki River, is well known for its large burial site dating back to the Finnish Iron Age. The first archaeological surveys took place in the 1980s by Pirkko-Liisa Lehtosalo-Hilander. Eurajoki River has been an important waterway from the Sea of Bothnia to the inner parts of Satakunta region towards the Lake Pyhäjärvi. Due to the land uplift process, the river has changed from those days. The assumed place of ancient village of Kauttua is just below the rapids between the Lake Pyhäjärvi and Eurajoki River.The site of the medieval village in Kauttua has been unknown. The oldest archive source, a cadastral map from the year 1696, presents a homestead of 10 houses by the bridge leading across Eurajoki River. A later cadastral map from 1790 presents large holdings of one farm at the same site and around it. There is still one building left at the river bank, close to the old bridge fundaments. In 2008PhD Kari Uotila and his team accomplished low aerial photo investigations above the site confined by information from historical maps. The photographs reveal an area of black soil just beside the only remaining building. They also reveal two light lines, presumably the earlier roads.Low aerial photo from the excavation site The first excavations since 1980´s took place last year. According to the findings from 2012, the new excavation site was cleared today.The excavations are running for a period of two weeks, and they are open for public, as well for adults as for children.

"239","For my PhD research, I have been working on a couple of Early Iron Age sites in northeastern Botswana. To put these sites in a comparable context, they are hilltop settlements from prehistoric farming and herding communities that date to roughly 1000 AD in the Kalahari Desert. The sites I am working on are only a couple of dozens of known sites clustered in the region in which I have been working, and the region (northeastern Botswana) is generally considered part of the broader geographical and cultural region of Southern Africa (including what is now South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique). Southern Africa experienced a substantial influx of settlement by farming and herding populations (who migrated south from Central and East Africa) in the first millennium AD, resulting in many hundreds of archaeological sites that now dot the landscape. Part of what is fascinating about studying communities from this time period (commonly called the Early Iron Age, for the metal-working technology the communities brought with them) is how interconnected they appear to have been, despite the often very long distances and harsh terrain separating various settlement locations. Evidence of shared technology, village organization, ceramic styles, and participation in long-distance trade spans across much of Southern Africa for this time period. But equally fascinating are the sites, or components of sites, that don’t appear to fit the ‘typical’ pattern – certain archaeological sites have yielded ceramics or other types of artifacts with unusual styles or other unexpected material, for example, with radiocarbon dates earlier or later than would be expected for that kind of material.Southern Africa was not a place void of human occupation before Early Iron Age population began their colonization of the subcontinent. Hunter-gatherer communities had thrived in the many varied ecological zones found in Southern Africa – from the damp, misty Cape to the sunny, arid Namib Desert – for tens of thousands of years before Iron Age communities establishes themselves in the area. Hunter-gatherers continued to subsist alongside the newcomers under a variety of conditions, sometimes coexisting in separate communities on the same landscape, at other times disappearing from the archaeological record (either moving to new territory or becoming subsumed into the more sedentary farmer society), or setting up camp nearby and apparently trading goods and services with the farming and herding villages. Archaeologists believe that the presence of hunter-gatherers in Early Iron Age communities can account for some of the ‘atypical’ sites or site components – the pieces that don’t seem to fit the basic Iron Age ‘pattern.’ It certainly would make sense, if two vastly different socioeconomic groups coexist on a landscape, to expect to see something different going on from when only one socioeconomic group is around. Of course, you can’t get even two archaeologists to agree on everything (where would be the fun in that?), and so a lot of the research being done on the Early Iron Age is to understand HOW much variation comes from the presence of hunter-gatherers, or even what it means to be, or ‘stay’ hunter-gatherer as part of a farming community, as well as understanding that part of the variation in the archaeological record that cannot be accounted for by hunter-gatherers. The Early Iron Age lasted for several centuries. Many archaeologists, myself included, expect that populations during this time period did not have perfectly static behavioral or cultural traditions. We want to tease out and better understand more of the differences among communities – nowadays there is a lot of talk about ‘regional variation,’ based on recent findings. My work, for example, looks to compare geographically broad understandings, or models, of the Early Iron Age with the very site-specific findings of the sites I excavated.The tricky part of making sense of all of this, as is usually the case with archaeology, comes when one tries to fit the ‘broad view’, or general model of how things are understood, such as I just described above, with a more ‘narrow view’ such as the data one collects during fieldwork on a particular site, or after fieldwork during post-excavation data collection and analysis. The Early Iron Age of Southern Africa looks very, very different when viewed at the level of one site, or one set of artifacts in a lab, than it does as viewed through nice, neat descriptions on the pages of journal articles; it takes quite a lot of work to get from one to the other (more than I myself can even say – as a PhD candidate I have not published anything peer-reviewed yet!). So how DOES one understand what is going on at just one site, or just one batch of artifacts, in terms of how it relates to an entire centuries-long, geography-specific cultural horizon? It is more than just counting and naming the types of artifacts we found during our excavations at the site (though that is a part of the process too), and it is a lot more than simply plugging in one piece to an existing puzzle.Every archaeologist will probably give you a somewhat different answer to the question I just asked above, and there’s something about that which is crucial to understanding archaeology as a discipline – we don’t all work in the same way, because we not only have different specialties and areas of interest, but we also operate under some different sets of theoretical assumptions and employ some variation in our methods as well.  That said, here’s a rundown of what I have been working on in the last couple of months in the interest of advancing my PhD research:Learning more about archaeological sites that are contemporaneous with the ones I excavated. I know – didn’t I take the time to read and research this before I set out on fieldwork? Of course I did, otherwise the National Science Foundation would have never seen fit to fund my work – but there is a major difference between what gets excavated at a site and what ends up published about it. I’ve been talking, endlessly, to anyone I can pin down in one place long enough to tell me more about the sites they worked on, and their assemblages, how they compare with mine, methods of analysis they used, and other information that I could not have anticipated before I did my fieldwork. Honestly I think some researchers see me coming and hide because they know I’m going to ask them more questions. But nevermind that – I want as much comparative, contextual information as I can (pragmatically) manage in order to understand the finds from my own excavations.Cataloging finds and conducting basic analysis on some categories of finds. Inventory, inventory, inventory. I can’t say much of anything substantive about technology, behavior, diet or anything else from the Early Iron Age unless I know what I’ve got, how much of it I’ve got, and in some cases, what it’s made of or what class of thing it is. For example, how much animal bone and tooth was recovered, and where was it found on the site? Which excavation units contained glass beads or burned seeds, and at what depths? I can’t say how many times I’ve revised and revamped the spreadsheets and other forms that contain my catalogue, in order to make sure my data are being managed properly. The same ought to go for the artifacts themselves – it’s a bigger job in a lot of cases, but the artifact collections likewise need to be stored and managed so that they are properly preserved as well as easily accessible.Networking with other researchers to arrange more in-depth analyses of portions of the artifact assemblage. I cannot do everything myself, especially since I do not right now have the specialized training needed to conduct radiocarbon dating, species-specific zooarchaeological (animal bone) identification, and a full-scale ceramic identification. I also don’t have the time – I am trying to finish my degree in about a year’s time, and each of these analyses can take months! Instead, as the lead investigator on the work at the site, I coordinate agreements with specialists to conduct some of the analysis for me. They get pay, and credit, and I get expert-level feedback which I can then cite in my dissertation. It also builds partnerships and may lead to further work down the road. It’s generally good for everyone.Taking notes. Lab notes, field notes, conference notes, lunchtime notes if I have a sudden inspiration, whatever. Constantly documenting what I am doing and why I am doing it; who I’ve talked to and what they said, etc. Not only will this help me write the methods section of my dissertation, it has also proved crucial for maintaining a consistent and rational methodology while still in the process of collecting the data. It’s really easy to think you’ll remember why you labeled that artifact bag a certain way, but in your memory, that one detail is going to get lost among the millions of others eventually.Asking for help. It goes without saying that I need help – I’m just one person, for starters, and I’m still a student running my first research project, for another. It also goes without saying that the networking, collaboration and feedback I talk about above would not be happening without substantial help from my advising committee, other graduate students, and colleagues who have stepped forward with suggestions and offers of aid. However, I also have had to push myself to ask openly for help, in the form of volunteer assistance, and faculty advice, loans of equipment, and all sorts of other things. No way I’d be pulling off this project without these. I am not the sort of person who instinctively or comfortably asks for help for just about anything, so it has really been part of my education to learn what I cannot do on my own, and how to seek that assistance.Keeping up with the literature. It’s part of any academic’s work, and it doesn’t go away just because I’m actively dissertating! I had to scramble to brief myself on recent research findings just before a conference last month because I’d been so focused on data collection over the last year or so. I couldn’t believe how much I’d missed in just twelve months.Working on other projects. As if all this weren’t enough, right? But it doesn’t pay the bills, unfortunately, and it won’t until I graduate and land a full-time position, so until then I make my way by teaching classes (when I can get them) and applying for small university-level scholarships and fellowships, some of which are stipends for smaller research or education projects. Then there’s also student loans, but I don’t want to think about those…I am at the point now where I’ve collected the great majority of data I need for analysis, and arranged for the rest to be conducted by specialists. My own in-depth analysis of the data will be the next step: I am planning a multi-scalar spatial analysis of the material components of one site with the intent to compare them to some other contemporary sites excavated by other researchers in the past, with the intent to gain a better understanding of how much spatial patterning is the result of site formation processes and how much is the result of patterned, intentional cultural behavior. How much of this will end up in the dissertation is up for discussion, because that’s a LOT of work. But if there’s one way to sum up archaeological research, it’s this: there’s always more to do!The Post-Excavation: What happens after you dig a site? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"240","Working on the microscopeSo this is my second year taking part in the Day of Archaeology. It’s great to look back at my post from last year, when I was working as a research associate on the Feeding Stonehenge project – lots of new things have happened since then, including a new position for me as a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh. Since joining Edinburgh I’ve been working on a lot of new and exciting projects, which you can read more about in my blog, Castles and Coprolites. This week I’ve mostly been sat in front of a microscope, analysing thin section samples from the site of Paisley Caves, Oregon USA, directed by Dr Dennis Jenkins. Paisley provides evidence for the earliest dated human occupation in North America, famously in the form of ancient human DNA recovered from coprolites, aka fossilised faeces. The samples I am working on are known as thin section micromorphology samples – perhaps not as well known as animal bones and charred plant remains, thin section samples investigate the actual sediments in which archaeological materials are found.The way in which sediments are deposited can actually tell us a great deal about the environment and human activity in the past, and are also useful in helping interpret the artefacts that are found within the sediment. For example looking at soils and sediments under the microscope, we can tell whether they were deposited by wind or water action, or whether they were trampled by humans or animals. With the Paisley samples we are looking at the formation processes in the cave environment, to see whether this can help understand the activities that were occuring in the cave.Thin section slide of sediments from Paisley caves. Photo by Julie Boreham, Earthslides.comThin section micromorphology is quite a specialised technique, and requires laboratory processing. We cut out blocks of sediment from profiles during excavation, wrap them very carefully to avoid any disturbance, then take them to the lab where they are set in resin and cut into slides for viewing under the microscope. I have been working with Earthslides to process the Paisley samples, and we will be presenting a poster exhibiton of the thin sections at the European Association of Archaeologists conference this September.The Paisley Caves – a view from the microscope by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"241","From Jennifer Jones, Cardiff University, Zooarchaeologist, Bioarchaeologist. I’m part of the faunal team at the Neolithic World Heritage site of Çatalhöyük this year, and have been residing here for the past 4 and a half weeks (two more to go!). Çatalhöyük is a Neolithic town in the Konya Plane in Turkey, and for three months every year is home to 120+ archaeologists all studying and researching at the site, allowing for great interaction between specialists, excavators, and theorists.Today is actually a bit of an unusual day for us here as it is our day off, and we have made the mammoth 8 hour long journey to Gobekli Tepe, which answers the question “what do archaeologists do on their day off?”- go and visit more archaeology of course! Gobekli Tepe is an amazing site with many weird and wonderful stone sculptures, which have been suggested as having ritual significance so we are very lucky to have this opportunity to go and see it for ourselves and see how it compares to the archaeology we’ve been finding at Çatalhöyük.Typically I’ve been spending my days analysing large quantities of bone. I’m working on a post-doctoral project looking human: animal relations in the early co-mingled human and animal bone deposits. I’ve been working with Chris Knüsel in the human remains team, which has been a great opportunity to share knowledge and information. I’ve been looking in detail at processing of bones, looking at butchery patterns, and fragmentation, and other features that can give hints as to what has happened to the bones before they made it to my lab. So far I’ve identified over 2000 specimens to species, and measured/examined fragmentation of 11,400 pieces of bone. I’ve been finding a nice range of Auroch, Boar, deer, and sheep/goat (a particular favourite of the former inhabitants of Çatalhöyük), and lots of dog bones. The deposit I’m looking at is unusual as it is from an offsite area of the mound, and has much higher proportions of wild species than assemblages from the mains settlement, so I have to try and think about why there are differences in the species represented.Working here has been a great opportunity to make connections with other specialists from all around the world, and we work long hours (7am-7pm!) because we love what we do. We’ve had a lot of fun in the process too, attending 1920’s themed costume parties, participating in pub quizzes (with beer as a prize-a major incentive to win!), and playing in table tennis tournaments, and socialising within the multi-national team.It’s been a productive field season so far, with huge numbers of burials, animal bone installations being found, and who knows what the next few weeks will bring?The Zooarchaeology at Çatalhöyük by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"243","Day of Archaeology 2013 for me means being away on 2 months of fieldwork in the southern Massif Central, France.  I’ve been contributing to DOA since 2011, and if you look back, it’s clear a lot has changed  since then (see my four 2011 posts, and 2012). After my PhD I was searching for a postdoc for several years, ran out of time and money to keep looking, and ended up seredipitously with a contract to write a book about humans and birds in prehistory.I thought that would be it, and that the 2013 Day of Archaeology would take place without a contribution from me. But it seems that archaeology wasn’t quite done with me…My workspace at the field station, Laussonne, Haut LoireAs I wrote in a postscript comment to my post last year, only a few days after writing about the difficult process of changing paths from a research career to one focused on writing and wider communication, an email dropped into my inbox from the European Commission offering the very last postdoc funding I applied for- a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship to work in at the PACEA lab, Universite of Bordeaux. After a lot of soul-searching on the wisdom of doing another 180 degree turn in my life trajectory, and talking with my husband about him coming out with me, I decided to go for it. And so here I am, in the mountains of the Massif Central!Laussonne mapThe field station for Archeo-Logis at Laussonne, Haut LoireMy postdoc is focused on two elements: training in a new skill (the Marie Curie Fellowships are especially concerned with career development), and applying this method to an archaeological context. I’ve written on my own blog in more detail about my project, which is called TRACETERRE. This stands for “Tracing Neandertal Territories: Landscape Organisation and Stone Resource Management“. It’s part of a larger collaborative project directed by my boss, Jean-Paul Raynal, and Marie-Helene Moncel.Essentially I’ll be learning a detailed geological technique called petro-archaeology, that allows us to determine where in the landscape Neandertals were obtaining the raw materials to make their stone tools. Specifically, we are especially interested in the flint sources: most of the geology in the area is igneous, which means it comes from volcanic action (the Massif Central is a world famous centre for volcanology, where you can see virtually every type of volcano and lava).Sancy Massif, north of where I am based, showing volcanic formationsIt’s possible to make stone tools from these kinds of rocks, but they are often very hard, and can also be coarse. Flint is a sedimentary rock, meaning it forms from the slow accumulation of mineral deposits. Flint is famous for the high quality tools that can be made from it, because of the predictable way it fractures. It’s often associated with Cretaceous chalk deposits, such as the big cliffs in the southern UK, where you can see black bands of flint nodules. So flint forms in marine contexts, but it can also form in other situations such as in lakes.Although there are few primary sources of flint in the Massif Central (i.e. outcrops of rock containing flint), there are many different secondary sources. These can be eroded outcrops, material washed into river gravels and other kinds of sources. My training will be in identifying these secondary types of sources, based on the way the outer surface of flint cobbles changes during the process of first formation, erosion and later exposure at archaeological sites.Some of the geological reading I’ve been getting up to speed on. Volcanoes galore!Because there are more than 70 different secondary sources in the region which have been painstakingly identified over more than thirty years (by Paul Fernandes, who will train me), this is too much to try to attempt to learn in two years. So I will be using a source-centred approach, where I look at one flint source, and see how this particular rock has been used by Neandertals. In particular, we are interested in where this rock ends up: which caves or open-air archaeological sites is it found in? And secondly, in what form does it occur: as finished tools, raw blocks, or flakes of stone that have been struck off blocks (cores) but not yet made into tools.Finding these things out can tell us a huge amount about techno-economics: the way in which Neandertals were choosing to organise their exploitation of resources on landscape scales. For example, working out which types of technology they used to make tools and which stages of tool production occur where can reveal the level of investment of energy: were they making tools quickly, and dropping them soon afterwards? Or were they carefully choosing which kinds of tools to make, and which ones to take with them in toolkits, maintaining them by re-sharpening? Both these strategies can be used as adaptations to different situations, particularly the level of mobility.A handaxe, one type of tool Neandertals seem to have carried with them as part of mobile toolkits, which could be re-sharpened and used in many tasks. This one is from near Bournemouth, UKThe question of Neandertal mobility is also a key reason for studying in such detail the different sources of stone used. We want to know where the stone from a flint source was going: which sites is it found in? How far was flint being transported, especially in comparison to other stone types? We can even begin to work out the paths taken through the landscape by Neandertals: did they have to cross rivers, high mountainous areas? Which passes would have been likely to be used? We also plan to excavate at the flint source itself, to see what activities were taking place, and also which tools came from other places in the landscape.We can then begin, by combining all the geological and techno-economic data, to build up a detailed understanding of the inter-connections between different parts of the landscape that Neandertals were living in. And this is just the stone tools: other parts of the archaeological record, such as animal bones preserved in caves, are studied by other project members. We can use these to determine things like what season people were living at sites, and where they were probably hunting the animals in the landscape.Gravel bar system, Switzerland- one example of a secondary source of stone.

But the impact of sourcing flint tools goes even further, because if we can map the extent of inhabited landscapes, we can start to think about territories. This is crucial because territories are not just regions full of resources- they probably were also involved in defining social interactions between different Neandertal groups. This is something we are still learning how to measure, but it has huge significance because different kinds of territories and social interactions suggests particular cognitive capacities. This is of course one of the key areas of research in human evolution: how did Neandertals differ from us, and how were they similar? Did they have similar webs of social connections, or were they living local, isolated lives in small groups that did not regularly meet? If this was the case, how did they find mates, and prevent huge in-breeding? All these fundamental questions can be advanced by new data and investigations such as the research I am doing.Right now, I’ve only been here just over a week, and am only one month into a two year postdoc. So there’s a long way left to go. But it’s very exciting, and I hope to start the petro-archaeology training and looking at the flint collections very soon. Meanwhile, there’s always time on fieldwork to have a day off, check out the local wildlife, cuisine and culture, and enjoy some of the lovely sunsets in this region. Very different landscapes to when Neandertals were living here! Sunset at LaussonneI am funded through a European Commission Framework 7 Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship for Career Development, and I work at the PACEA laboratory, UMR-5199, Universite Bordeaux 1.The Tracing Neandertal Territories in the Mountains of Southeast France by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"245","Archaeological Services Inc. (ASI) is one of the largest archaeological consulting firms in Canada with over thirty years experience in the production and dissemination of knowledge concerning our past. We have over 100 full-time and seasonal staff members and three offices – two in Toronto and one in Burlington. Our company is divided into separate divisions and here you will find little snapshots about what each field director or division at ASI is doing at the moment. Enjoy!From Field Director Robb B:Today I was stripping on site. Now that’s not what you think it means. We began stripping/removing the topsoil from our site today in hopes to uncover settlement patterns. We started roughly 20m away from outside the limit of the previously mapped extent of artifacts (as determined by surface artifact scatter or test unit artifact drop-off). As we move northward and closer to the main concentration of artifacts, hopefully we’ll find some sort of settlement pattern!The Gradall machine stripping the topsoil off Robb’s site.From the Built Heritage and Cultural Heritage Landscape Planning Division:Built Heritage and Cultural Heritage Landscapes is busy this week with projects that are taking place in Downtown Toronto, in the farming communities near Toronto and in a very old and historic area near Niagara Falls.  The cultural heritage assessments that we do are a form of archaeology that takes place ‘above ground’. Right now, one staff member is working on cultural heritage evaluation of bridges in Eastern Ontario and even managed to find an old bridge in the middle of the bush! Another member of the team is developing a plan for salvaging architectural material from nineteenth-century properties that are slated for removal. Meanwhile, the team near Niagara Falls is exploring ways in which modern  infrastructure projects can fit into a landscape that is associated with Canadian heroine Laura Secord and which still contains a number of important historic sites. And, in downtown Toronto a team is looking at how the built heritage of the city can be best preserved; their work will contribute to the establishment of three new heritage conservation districts in the city.The incredibly talented (and good-looking) Built Heritage team.From The Geomatics Team:Today Blake is overlaying historical maps of Fort York dating back to 1815 and digitizing the buildings and features in Geographic Information System (GIS). This will allow researchers to examine the changes that have occurred at the Fort overtime. It will also aid officials to better protect their hidden archaeological resources should improvements within the fort be planned.  Shady is working with CAD files provided by clients in GIS and he is mapping built heritage features and areas that have archaeological potential that could be impacted by different alternates of transit projects. The clients can take Shady’s graphics and avoid archaeologically sensitive areas and they can try to ensure that built heritage features are not negatively impacted by future development.From Field Director Jes:My crew and I are currently working on a stage three historic site being impacted by a service line associated with a wind turbine. The view is quite nice, with 7 foot corn on one side and a farm with animals on the other. Unfortunately, excavating here is like trying to dig through a rubber tire, but my team is tough and knows how to get things done! Below is a a shot of the crew as well as our monitors from Caldwell, Walpole Island, and Chippewas of the Thames First Nation.Jes’s crew on site beside the cornfields.From the Special Projects Division:ASI is also conducting excavations at Exhibition Place in downtown Toronto at the site of the East Enlisted Men’s Barracks of the New Fort York. Eventually, the exposed foundation of the barracks will be placed under glass and featured in an entranceway to a new hotel.In south-western Ontario, ASI is investigating dozens of new sites dating to between six and three thousand years ago in cooperation with Six Nations of the Grand.  ASI is also currently documenting the artifact assemblages recovered over the last century from a number of Huron-Wendat ossuaries prior to their return to the earth as part of a large repatriation project planned for later this fall. The Huron-Wendat Nation, the University of Toronto, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority and the Ontario Heritage Trust are jointly participating in the project.From Field Director Wes:Our crew (Wes, Nina, Chris, and Kristen) have been excavating the remains of three outbuildings located behind the East Enlisted Mens Barracks at the New Fort Site in Toronto. The foundations of the buildings are partially intact, as are numerous brick and clay drains associated with the buildings. The first photo shows the remains of a brick and limestone structure built overtop of an earlier limestone privy building. It also shows that we are constantly having to battle ground and rain water! The second photo shows the remains of a brick sewer drain later replaced by a clay drain, both of which are beneath the limestone foundation of what was known as a Cleaning Shed.The foundations and drain from Wes’s site.From one of the Material Culture Analysts:I come into our box filled office that I share with two other historic analysts and pull out the collection that I’m currently working on. Each bag full of artifacts is labelled according to its provenience and I work provenience by provenience to lay out each bag’s contents and assign a catalogue number to every artifact, and slowly my database grows!Typical desk of an ASI material culture analyst.From Field Director Stacey:We have been working on a stage three pre-contact settlement. So we have been digging a 1x1m unit every 10m in order to determine how large the site is and create a grid of units across the site.  When we find a unit with over 100 artifacts we will dig four more units one on each side, 5m away from it. So far we have found lots of pottery, fragments of chert (flint) and animal bone. We have also found evidence of the walls of the houses in the site from post moulds in the ground. Once we finish determining how large the site is, we will begin stage four, block excavation.Stacey resting in one of her (very deep) 1×1 units!From the Environmental Assessment Division:Work continues along the expansion corridor of a major east-west highway north-east of the City of Toronto.

Previously disturbed by road construction, ASI crews will be on site this summer salvaging data resulting from proposed road improvements.From the TPOK Organizers:On Thursday, July 25th, ASI hosted its bi-monthly lecture series, Two Pints of Knowledge (TPOK).  TPOK started at ASI two years ago and has been a resounding success in drawing large groups of ASI employees out to its bi-monthly lectures.  By covering a broad range of topics from lithics and pre-contact ceramics to present-day garbology and historic beer tasting, in an informal, company-sanctioned space, and often lubricated by a beer (or two), TPOK has created a space of learning and socialization within a corporate, CRM environment.ASI staff and TPOK regulars listening to one of the Thursday evening talks.The existence of such spaces is paramount to the well-being and sustained ethicacy of the CRM industry at a time when the deadlines placed upon the industry by their clients are making the existence of such events harder and harder to host.  As the last line of defense in the daily battle to preserve cultural heritage, it is critical for contract archaeologists to keep up with the developing methodological and theoretical trends happening within the discipline.  While life and bills and a full work schedule get in the way with much of the reading that goes along with the work conducted by our colleagues in university and public sector-based academia, facilitating a lecture series like TPOK allows contract archaeologists to spread much of the research work along them while bringing fellow-minded archaeologists together for open discussion.  Thus, not only does TPOK allow for training and education in a socially-friendly format, it creates an open environment so that new conceptions on how best to approach cultural heritage management can emerge.  It is our hope that TPOK continues to be a thriving success and that similar venues spring up in other CRM companies to advance the cause of heritage conservation around the world.From Laboratory Services:The lab is the entry point for all artifacts that are coming in from the field.  We wash, sort, organize and keep track of all the artifacts excavated by ASI crews.  Every day is different since we receive such a wide range of artifacts, everything from precontact lithic scatters to nineteenth century urban sites.  Being in the lab we have the privilege of seeing the best finds come in from the field as well as discover the secrets of seemingly mundane artifacts. Today we received four bags of artifacts from the New Fort site, more specifically from privies associated with the enlisted men’s barracks (see Wes above).We also worked on washing, sorting, and cataloguing some artifacts that came from various sites associated with a major east-west highway northeast of the city of Toronto.  Two of these sites are villages from the pre-contact era, which include beautiful decorated pottery, pipes and stone tools.  We also washed a small 19th century historic surface collection which had some nice decorated ceramics, a pipe stem, some bottle finishes and machine made nails.  This surface collection will be analysed and catalogued in the lab, to determine if this site needs to be excavated further.In order to keep up with all the artifacts that arrive from our 10 field crews we have a partnership with the University of Toronto’s Archaeology Centre where we rent a space in their building as well as hire archaeology students to wash artifacts. Right now they’re washing a collection from a redware pottery. Because the site includes all the refuse, misfires, and other cast-offs there’s a lot to wash!A collection of pictures taken yesterday in the ASI lab and the U of T lab.From the Toronto Survey Division:The Toronto Survey division has recently completed the assessment of a project at the crossroads of two former concession roads in the Region of Peel. The subject property was comprised of a portion of a former landfill site and recently ploughed lands adjacent to a water course along the west perimeter. The former landfill portion of the site was deemed to have no remaining archaeological potential, while the ploughed lands were subject to a pedestrian survey at five metre intervals.  Despite careful scrutiny no archaeological finds were discovered.From Field Director Rob W:Today our group is focusing on some rolling landscape. We were all thankful for the break in the heat and the rise in the windspeed as we searched for artifacts on the hills and valleys of our long-standing project. More field crews working on site together meant time for catching up on projects from across Ontario. Nothing improves the work day like running into old friends in a familiar place.Rob W’s crew, Kiara’s crew and Jes’ crew working together on a slope!If you would like to learn more about our most famous projects and artifacts, visit our website here.If you would like to learn more about us on a daily basis, follow us on Facebook, Twitter @ArchaeologyTO, and LinkedIn.Thanks for stopping by!The A Day in the Life of Archaeological Services Inc.

"253","Our project coinciding with the Day of Archaeology 2012 was to build up an “excavation” for children to dig at the Cheshire Children’s Museum in Keene, NH, USA. The excavation activity will be in the Egypt themed area. At first I fretted over how we could possibly replicate an Egyptian excavation within our 2 m x 1 m box (that just wasn’t going to happen!). I decided to focus on simply portraying a few main ideas–the measured square units that archaeologists dig; the idea of layers– so that this excavation activity would look more like archaeology and a little less like a sandbox.I am very lucky that my husband Randall, an architect, designer, and person who knows how to make anything with fiberglass, agreed to help with this project. First we stacked sheets of foam into an excavation grid with several different “layers.” After a messy first attempt that caused some of our materials to self-destruct, Randall worked with sticky resin and fiberglass fabric to mold the excavation units and places for artifacts, while I made some “ancient” ceramic sherds out of pots from Agway. (As I mentioned in my preliminary post, it proved to be rather difficult to find suitable artifact replicas to purchase for the exhibit.) Later, we applied more sloppy glue and a bucket of sand to the fiberglass surface, and glued the artifacts into their layers (based on rather loose relative dating).Creating archaeology = messy basement!What a relief when we delivered this mold to the museum and it fit right into its designated crate! To this will be added some loose sand, so that children can dig and discover the artifacts. Setting the scene further will be excavation tools (or, children’s shovels, etc.) and grid indicators/measurements, and an Egyptian desert mural behind the excavation. In addition to digging, we plan to provide clipboards so that children can choose to draw or record their finds. Based on my 7-year-old’s suggestion, we’ll also provide an “artifact report”/ “fun facts” sheet for each of the artifacts. She and her sister are really excited to learn more about these mysterious items, so I’m hoping that will be true for all the local children who visit the museum!The mock excavation table, in situ in its museum home.If time, space, and budgets permit, I’d love to add additional activities or games, perhaps some puzzle activities for the younger children. But this is only one small part of a museum with many different topics and activities. So for now, if a few children share in the fun of discovery, and leave with some idea that real archaeological excavation involves those neat square holes in the ground,* or if a few children are inspired to learn about ancient cultures, we’ll be thrilled! *My subliminal anti-looting message for the youngsters!In addition to thanking Randall Walter, who did all the dirty work here, I’d also like to thank the Cheshire Children’s Museum for the opportunity to work on this fun project, and Rita Elliott, a fellow archaeologist who, although I have never met her, took time out to discuss with me ideas for “mock excavation” activities.

"254","I saw the poster for the Day of Archaeology (DoA) in our lift and thought I’d join in, looking at the importance of archives to the documentation and re-interpretation of older excavations. I planned to focus on archives related to the first century of excavations by a fairly eccentric cast of characters from the British School at Athens, at Knossos in Crete, where I am currently working. But in the event, I’ve been side-tracked in quite different directions, digging into the archives of John Evans, allowing me to dip into archaeology in five countries in one day, all without leaving an overcast London.Last July, one of the former Directors of the Institute here in London, Professor John Davies Evans, died at the age of 86. I didn’t know John well, we had only met a few times, but we had a good talk at a workshop held at Sheffield in 2006, organised in honour of John and his excavations at Knossos in 1958-60 and 1969-70, which provide the entire framework for, and our most comprehensive evidence supporting, our understanding of the four millennia of the Neolithic period on Crete (see V. Isaakidou and P. Tomkins (eds) 2008. Escaping the Labyrinth. The Cretan Neolithic in Context. Oxford: Oxbow Books). As we talked, it was clear John was extremely pleased that his work at the site was still considered so fundamental, and he was also immensely relieved to be able to hand over the completion of its publication to others.Fig. 1. Saliagos. Left: the islet of Saliagos; right: the main trenchI was working at Knossos on a current project when I learned of John’s death. I knew that while he had handed over much of his Knossos excavation archive, a large amount of the original documentation had not yet been collected from him. This was needed for the full publication of his excavations, and would eventually be archived in the British School at Athens.Fig. 2. John Evans sorting Saliagos pottery on AntiparosVia e-mail, I contacted his family, and we agreed that on my return from Crete in September, I would collect his academic papers, sort them, and determine how and where it would be most appropriate to archive them. With my Institute colleague Andrew Reynolds, and with help from John Lewis of the Society of Antiquaries, we collected all of John’s academic papers, and they have been taking up about half of my office ever since. (On the plus side, any meeting involving more than one other person has had to take place elsewhere – fa’coffee.)Fig. 3. Excavations in the central court of the Minoan palace at KnossosMy original hope of sorting the papers over the Christmas or Easter breaks disappeared behind mountains of marking, and it was only last week, when I finished that and could take over one of our vacant teaching rooms to unpack it all, that I had a chance to find out what’s there. Now having consolidated it into some 40 boxes, in place of the odd assortment of boxes, suitcases, a filing cabinet, card and slide chests and a full chest of drawers, I now don’t have to slam my door whenever our fire safety officer walks by.One of our recent PhD graduates who specialises in the history of archaeology, Amara Thornton, very kindly gave up her week to help me, and we’ve done a first sort of everything. So we now have an overview of the material, which allows us to approach others who we suspect may be interested in particular elements of the archive, and gives us an idea of the scale of the further detailed cataloguing which will be involved. I have no idea when we will be able to do this, and we will have to find some funding, as there will be a couple of months worth of work involved. But particularly relevant to today, are John’s excavation records, so let’s go digging in the archives, working, as archaeology usually does, from the known to the unknown.I was familiar with John’s excavations on the tiny Greek Cycladic islet of Saliagos, co-directed with Colin Renfrew in 1964-65 and published in 1968 as Excavations at Saliagos Near Antiparos. [Figs 1-2 above] I talked a local boatman into taking me to the tiny offshore islet about 20 years ago to see the over-grown ruins, so seeing colour slides of the site under excavation was a treat. Colin handed over the bulk of the excavation archive to the British School some years ago, but John kept his correspondence and many slides, so I’ll copy a few for teaching, before I pack them off to Athens.I was also very familiar with John’s Knossos excavations (Fig. 3 above and Fig. 4 below) from 1958-60 and 1969-70, through my own work at the site (our current project was the subject of a post for last year’s DoA by my colleague Andrew Shapland at the British Museum). The eight boxes of notebooks, finds lists, photos, and numerous rolls of plans and sections will be absolutely essential to complete the full publication of this major excavation. I’ve scanned and sent a couple of documents to Peter Tomkins in Leuven, which I know will help his current work on reconstructing the development of the Neolithic community.Fig. 4. The deep sounding in the central court at KnossosJohn is particularly well known for sorting out the sequence of prehistoric occupation on Malta, documented in his 1959 Malta in the classic Thames and Hudson ‘Peoples and Places’ series, and in more detail in his monumental survey of Maltese prehistory, The Prehistoric Antiquities of the Maltese Islands, published in 1971. [Fig. 5 below] Tucked away in the latter are extremely succinct accounts of small but strategic stratigraphic tests he did in 1953-55 in eight Maltese monuments, which enabled him to establish the cultural sequence used in his publications (and still valid) to organise the results from all previous investigations. I have found about 100 photographic negatives and some section sketches from these excavations, but so far, no detailed excavation notes, nor any plans; it is just possible he archived these in Malta, and any plans may be hiding among the many rolls of drawings which I have yet to sort through individually [Fig. 6 below].Fig. 5. John Evans on Malta, 1954-56.An exciting surprise was recognising several original excavation notebooks by other investigators on Malta, from 1911 to 1930, which John must have brought back to the UK to draw on for his synthesis, and over 300 early photos of sites and excavations, which should go to the archive of the National Museum in Malta. Some of these seem to have come to John from the Palestine Exploration Fund, and a note says ominously ‘Harris Colt Malta orig: throw away if not wanted 20s or 30s’ – thankfully he didn’t! I’ve e-mailed a former student, Anthony Pace, now the superintendent for cultural heritage on Malta, to work out how best to return this material. I hope we can locate John’s excavation notes, and link these with his abundant photographic documentation. As well as photos documenting his own tests, there are some 600 negatives of pottery and other finds, only some of which were used in his 1971 volume. More significant are some 300 negatives representing site visits he made in the early 1950s, only a few of which were eventually published, which document the condition of many monuments half a century ago. Altogether, this might just be the spur for a busman’s holiday to Malta, which I’ve wanted to visit for over 30 years.Fig. 6. Malta excavations 1954. Left: Hagr Qim trench E; right: Mnajdra trench CWhat I wasn’t at all familiar with, were John’s unpublished excavations, and I spent the week dashing off to the library, doing web-searches or sending e-mails to colleagues and former students, each time I stumbled across a new paper trail. With some follow-ups this week, I think I’ve now got the outlines, and since none of them are in my own field of specialisation, they generate some of the excitement of discovery, without having to say au revoir to decent coffee.The first surprise was an excavation John conducted jointly with Francisco Jordá Cerdá of the Seminario de Historia Primitiva del Hombre, in 1950, at the earlier Bronze Age Argaric site of La Bastida de Totana in south-east Spain. This was the last in a series of campaigns in a settlement with abundant intra-mural burials. [Fig. 7 below] I haven’t yet discovered any correspondence to indicate why John got involved, but he spent much of that year in Spain researching his PhD dissertation on the possible relations between Argaric Spain and Early Bronze Age Anatolia. The specifics of how he got involved in the project may eventually emerge from his papers, though I’ve found no clues so far.Fig. 7. La Bastida, 1950. Left: the excavation area; right: jar burial.An e-mail to a Spanish former PhD student, Borja Legarra Herrero, now working in both the Aegean and Spain, pointed me to the web-site of the recently resumed excavations at the site, now one of the largest field projects in Spai. There, and in interim publications, the directors indicate that in 2009 John had sent them the original excavation notebooks of his Spanish collaborator, which had been bequeathed to him in 1960, along with a photocopy of his own 1950 excavation notebook (still among his papers). [Fig. 8 below] Seemingly over-looked by John at that time, are 78 cards mounted with excavation photographs, primarily of burials in situ, identified by burial and context. These relate to the 1944-45 seasons of excavations, before John became involved in the project; there must be an interesting story of personalities and politics behind why these were sent to John, but whether we can piece it together from surviving clues at either end remains to be seen. By chance, I had taught Roberto Risch, a co-director of the new project, during his MA nearly 20 years ago, and an e-mail out of the blue from me received a reply within a couple of hours (though he cut it short because the Portugal vs Czech Republic Euro 2012 game was starting – I guess we all have priorities).Fig. 8. La Bastida, 1950, excavation notebookWhile the notebooks John sent them have allowed members of the current project to restudy the original material for publication, they had not come across these photographs in any archive in Spain, and they have had difficulty reconstructing the contexts of individual burials. (Purely coincidentally, Borja and Roberto met at a conference in Denmark a few weeks ago, and had arranged to meet for dinner while the former is working with me, and the latter is on holiday, on Crete in August; Borja planned to bring me along, though hadn’t yet mentioned it to me – I think I’d better go via the cashpoint, just to play it safe.)So the first of today’s tasks has been to finish scanning these photographs. Ultimately, I hope the originals will be returned to Spain for archiving with the other dig records and the finds in the newly built museum at the site. In the meantime, the scans should assist the study of the old material, which has been going on for several years, and Roberto is going to get back to me for higher resolution scans of some of the photos, for incorporation into the new museum displays.The second surprise was a series of small notebooks, a few photographs, more negatives, a few small bags with potsherds, and a box with 1/3 of a skull, from John’s 1956 excavation of three Bronze Age barrows at Earl’s Farm Down, just east of Amesbury, ca. 6 kilometres south-east of Stonehenge. [Fig. 9 below]John Evans at Earl’s Farm Down, 1956Amara had her laptop with her, and a Google led to the Wiltshire sites and monuments record, which, while not seemingly aware of John’s excavation, noted the excavation of four nearby barrows by Paul Ashbee in 1956. A quick run up to the library to consult Ashbee’s 1983 publication in the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine confirms which barrows were excavated by John, so we can put them on the map. A contemporary report (by John – uncredited, but the typescript is among his papers), included in N. Thomas 1958, ‘Excavation and field-work in Wiltshire: 1956′ Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine 56:238-40) provides information on each barrow, and indicates that these, as well as Ashbee’s excavations, were undertaken for the Department of the Environment, so this seems to have been fill-in employment just before John took up his appointment as Professor of Prehistoric European Archaeology at the Institute, to succeed Gordon Childe. [Fig. 10 below] Fig. 10. Earl’s Farm Down, 1956, excavation notebookA much later letter mentions in passing that John thought the finds were all stored in the Institute. On the off chance that there were more than the few sherds he had kept with the notebooks, I fired off an e-mail to my colleague Rachel Sparks, who manages our collections, only to get her out of office message – jury duty! However, that evening I got a message back that a search of the records suggests we have material from Earl’s Farm Down which wasn’t identified as John’s excavation in our records, so has been in that special limbo all collections have for under-documented material. So the second of today’s tasks has been to see whether this material is from the barrows, and to get an idea of the potential size of a publication project. The writing on the bags is John’s, and the recording system matches that on the few bags he kept with his notes, so that’s confirmed (see Rachel’s DoA entry). There is a fair collection of material, and with it in the box were a few more negatives, as well as a few finds from other sites which had been mis-filed in the same box. So confirmation for me, a few mysteries back to limbo for Rachel to try to sort out – but fewer than she started her DoA with, so I’d say we’re winning. Writing-up this excavation should be suitable as a student dissertation project, possibly for publication in WAM (I mentioned it in passing to Andrew Reynolds, the editor, and he’s interested), after which the finds and records should probably be archived with other local material in the Salisbury Museum.A third surprise was that John conducted a single season of trial tests in 1972 in collaboration with local archaeologists at the Iron Age hillfort of Segovia in southern Portugal. John’s principal academic interests were in the Mediterranean Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, so what led him to get involved in a major Iron Age and Roman site? [Fig. 11 below] Hopefully there will be some hint when I can work through the documentation and correspondence systematically. Again, purely coincidentally, his Portuguese collaborator, José Morais Arnaud, was completing his PhD at Cambridge when I began mine in 1980, and Teresa Judice Gamito expanded the 1972 trenches in connection with her own doctoral research in the early 1980s, publishing her thesis with BAR (Social Complexity in Southwest Iberia 800-300 B.C.), which we have upstairs, though we don’t have the Portuguese journal where she reported her excavations. Her summary indicates the importance of the excavation, providing the principal regional stratified sequence from the Late Bronze Age through the Roman conquest.Fig 11. Segovia, 1972. Left: site; right, summit trenchesThe documentation for this excavation is more extensive, involving several trench notebooks, photos, plans, sections and finds drawings, which I will need more time to sort through. Because the trenches were subsequently extended, I expect John gave his collaborators copies of everything, but I’m chasing this up with José to see if we can supply whatever may be needed for their archives, to facilitate future study.Following this trial field season, John became Director of the Institute, and administration seems to have taken over his life (a feeling all of us are now experiencing) and he stopped fieldwork; he was only able to return to working on his excavations after his retirement, as several boxes of transcribed notebooks, finds and photo lists for Knossos, along with a large box of computer disks testify (now I have to find a working Amstrad computer, to read the disks, to make sure we have copies of all the relevant files). Sorting the Segovia records, along with more detailed cataloguing of all of John’s papers, will have to wait until sometime in the winter at earliest, when I may get another chance to unpack the boxes. So I’ve just had to figuratively back-fill my excavation in the archives, until the next season.But as a final surprise, my query to Rachel about Earl’s Farm Down, has turned-up other materials in our storerooms, brought in by John, and checking these with Rachel is my third task for the DoA, which she has noted in her own DoA account. As well as various small bits of pottery useful for teaching purposes, given to John by excavators during his early travels in Spain, which we may be able to document more fully (presently simply catalogued by site name), two more significant collections exist. We have the human and animal skeletal material from his excavation of six communal rock-cut tombs at Xemxija on Malta. Summary reports on this material were included as appendices in John’s 1971 volume, but more could now be done to study the human remains in terms of community demography, the health and life history of individuals, and the social and ritual contexts of burial; the much smaller collection of animal bones holds much less potential. The former would repay new study, particularly in comparison with more recently excavated material, and could make an excellent dissertation project for a student on our MSc in skeletal and dental bioarchaeology.The second collection consists of two boxes of carbonised plant remains and soil samples (to which I can add another box John had at home) from Knossos. The site is one of half a dozen representing the earliest Neolithic communities in Europe, established ca. 7000 BC. The plant remains were originally studied as part of the British Academy’s Major Research Project on the Early History of Agriculture, with John taking enthusiastic advantage of the newly developed flotation recovery technique and fine sieving in his 1969-70 excavations. The botanical samples from the two different campaigns were distributed among different specialists in the UK and Denmark. I had hoped we could track down all of these through the paper trail of John’s administrative correspondence for the project – I wasn’t expecting to find any still in London. Checking them, they are still in bags with their context labels (Rachel and I took the opportunity to replace a few fragile bags) so their study should contribute to our understanding of early agriculture in the Aegean. I’ve notified Valasia Isaakidou of Sheffield University of this material, as she is co-ordinating the study and publication of the environmental and bioarchaeological material recovered by John at Knossos.Finally, still completely unexplored, are some rolls of plans and a box with the documentation and a few finds from several small excavations conducted by John’s wife, Evelyn Sladdin, before she started her undergraduate degree in Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge and met John. She published one, but the others, small Roman and Medieval digs, apparently not. I may have to pencil-in the ‘excavation’ of that multi-site box for the DoA next year.So what’s next? My priority for the autumn and winter, to fit in around teaching, will be to catalogue the Knossos documentation, about five times as much as all the rest together, as this major excavation is actively being worked up for publication by a number of colleagues, and the full documentation is eagerly awaited. Peter Tomkins, who is writing-up the stratigraphy and pottery from John’s excavations, and synthesising this with his own extensive work with Sir Arthur Evans’ tests below the Bronze Age palace, is coming to London in September for a meeting at the Society of Antiquaries being organised to commemorate John’s career, so I hope we can start going through this material together then.It’s frustrating to have started this ‘excavation’, but have to leave it – but then most real excavations are like that too. This has turned into a far larger, but also much more interesting task than I anticipated nearly a year ago when I contacted John’s family. From my conversation with John in 2006, when he was both pleased that his excavations at Knossos were still important, and relieved that their publication would be completed, I’m sure he would approve our excavating his archive, to make the material available to other researchers. This Day of Archaeology marks the last attention I can give to it for some time, but has clarified what we have, and what we need to do next. Realistically, considering the job ahead (and there is a lot more to his papers than just his excavation documentation), I think it may be some time before I’ll see the floor on that half of my office again. It’s been busy but intriguing – and it isn’t often that one can dig into archaeology in five different countries in one day.Today has also brought home forcefully three things that confront me every time I work on Knossian material: how productive and cost effective re-examining older material can be, despite the constant push to recover new evidence with up-to-date techniques; that we have a responsibility to squeeze as much information as we can out of what we dig up – it is a non-renewable resource; and how crucial it is to understand our own disciplinary history – who collected what, when and why – to understand that evidence most effectively.I’d like to thank Judith and Mike Conway, John Lewis, Andrew Reynolds, Kelly Trifilo, Stephen Shennan, Cathy Morgan, Peter Warren, Sandra Bond, Katie Meheux and Gabe Moshenska who helped arrange for and assisted the transfer of the material to the Institute of Archaeology; Lisa Fentress, Reuben Grima, Borja Legarra Herrero, José Morais Arnaud, Anthony Pace, Colin Renfrew, Artur Ribeiro, Roberto Risch and Tim Schadla-Hall for responding to my queries; Stuart Laidlaw for scanning slides and negatives; Amara Thornton for helping me sort John’s papers and providing details about some of the colourful characters who dug on the then colonial ‘circuit’; Rachel Sparks for chasing Institute collections records, digging out John’s material from the Institute storerooms, and helping me look through it; and the DoA folks for coping with this submission.All images from J.

"255","The day turned out to be very exciting as, at last, we have entered the 21st century with satellite broadband. This morning, 3 minutes per Mb, yes you read that right. Now, unimaginable speeds.Why does that matter so much? Time was, as a contracting archaeological surveyor I would have to go down to Edinburgh, over 4 hours drive each way, to look at databases and archives, and noted findings manually onto paper maps with pens and tippex. Now it’s all online, including reporting, and digital mapping has been a real headache.Now I’ve no excuse. It has seemed to me recently that good skills in identifying archaeological sites in the field, interpretation and placing them in their historical context, which I’m good at, comes definitely second to being able to keep up with technological advances. It’s hard as an independent contractor, with no buzzing office full of IT geeks to help out and no salary to allow time out for training. Still, all that time I can now waste watching YouTube clips…The An Exciting End to the Day by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"256","My day started at 5.30am to prepare for the long drive to the site,  the little inn where we have been lodged offers a large full English breakfast, which would really keep you going for most of the day, unfortunately though we are leaving too early so no breakfast, just a cup of questionable  coffee ( mostly due to the UHT milk supplied in the little plastic pre-dosed container) in my  room.  I knock on the door of my colleague to make sure he is awake and after 10 minute we leave toward our site.We drive for 1 and a half hours on beautiful country roads , between spells of rain, sun and blast of strong winds..so me and my colleague joke about the weather changes that saying we are time travelling and we are quickly passing through each season of the year as the kilometers go by.  When we arrive on site we are greeted by our other colleague and the manager of the beautiful 18th century garden we are excavating, as we enter the garden a flock of roe deers with their babies run pass us and cheer all of us up!The project is trying to relocate several features of the ancient garden  as the Lord that owns it  (is manor house is within the garden/ estate) wants to restore it to its former beauty.  Suddenly a heavy rain fall comes down and in few minutes rivers of water come down from everywhere, lightening and thunder seems to fall just next to us, and being in the middle of a woodlands is not really a safe place to be during thunderstorm… Thanks god the master gardener came to rescue us and with our extreme surprise and relief he takes us  to the house, he said we  have been permitted to use the “posh” toilets instead of the public one, and that he arranged for tea and coffee to be served to us to warm us up, since by then we were as wet as the pond we were excavating! In order to be allowed in the toilet the maid, with a horrified face requested us that we took off our boots and waterproof gear as we are too dirty to be allowed in even if only for the toilet!! So there we go in the toilet shoeless ( they were spotless)! Though we get rewarded by been offered proper coffee and tea in one of the tea room of the house, all accompanied by the most beautiful  and tasty biscuits ever! As we are terrorised to dirt or stain of mud the sitting we just all stand around (still shoeless) with our warm tea and lovely biscuits in the hand, and marvel at the fact that they gave  real delicate china tea cups and real silver spoons!!The rain eventually stopped and we got back to the real world of archaeology, muddy boots and all. After few hours we pack our tools and head back toward  our little inn in what it use to be the first Saxon town ( or so the sign at the town entrance says) we time travel again for 1 and half our through the 4 seasons and eventually arrive to the inn, quick shower , something to eat in the little pub down the road and then  finally to bad to prepare for another day of archaeology and hopefully more silver spoons and lovely tea cakes!!The Excavating a Beautiful 18th Century Landscape Garden by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"257","Who knew that the meeting Kary and I would have with the folks at the Capitol City Museum in downtown Frankfort, Kentucky on Day of Archaeology 2012 would be such a pregnant one! and actually, as our picture shows, Kary IS pregnant… Kary Stackelbeck and Gwynn Henderson just before we left for our incredible Day of Archaeology 2012 meetingOur meeting was about planning an education project for school students to be held on National Archaeology Day in October at the site of an historic dairy atop Fort Hill in Frankfort. But by the time our meeting was over, 2.5 hours later, all of us in attendance (Kary, me, John, and Mike) had laid the foundation for a much longer-term project. It included a survey for all prehistoric and historic sites on the city park; and the development of a long-term research, education, interpretation, and management program for the sites.For 2012, there will be visits to the local schools with artifacts already recovered from historic sites on the park to show students tangible remains of their local history; and tours will be held at the park, to engage the public and to kick-off the project.WOO HOO!!!! This is what public archaeology is all about!! Archaeolgists and community members collaborating for the benefit of everyone and for the resource, too.It just goes to show you, that in ANY aspect of archaeology, in the field or out of it, you don’t always know what you’ll find, and you need to be prepared for anything!!!Hope everyone’s Day of Archaeology 2012 was as productive as Kary’s and mine! The Meeting the Challenge of Public Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"259","I’ll write this post in Italian because I’m more familiar with my language: at the end of the post you’ll find an English abstract of my report.La vita dell’archeologo digitale, nonostante il periodo che viviamo pieno di computer e “diavolerie” tecnologiche, è tutt’altro che facile: non è un problema soltanto italiano, seppure l’Italia è il Paese che meno a livello accademico sta facendo per mantenersi al passo e, mai come in questo caso, la colpa non è degli amministratori che ci governano. Personalmente mi ritengo uno dei fortunati che è riuscito a portare avanti la sua passione verso le nuove tecnologie fino al dottorato, che sto per concludere all’Università di Roma “La Sapienza”. I problemi sono molteplici e non è certo questa la sede per affrontarli, ma molta strada è ancora da percorrere, soprattutto finché ogni gruppo di ricerca si farà il suo digitale, invece che lavorare con gli altri gruppi per creare delle best practices comuni che possano armonizzare le grandi quantità di dati digitali che vengono generati. Da anni cerco di seguire il più possibile, attraverso convegni nazionali ed internazionali, i lavori dei principali gruppi che si occupano di Virtual Heritage, dalle esperienze di Frisher in Virginia, a quelle di Donaeu a Vienna, piuttosto che in Italia al CNR di Roma o presso FBK a Trento. Mi sono anche quest’anno fatto promotore di un incontro dedicato all’archeologia virtuale, dove sono state mostrate diverse indagini legate alla possibilità di comunicare l’archeologia attraverso i nuovi media digitali: il materiale ed i video dell’evento sono o saranno presto in rete.Dal canto mio, le giornate scorrono piuttosto tranquillamente, tra scadenze da rispettare, vita da biblioteca, PC sempre troppo acceso. Negli ultimi tempi, per rimanere in tema al “Day of Archaeology”, per il mio progetto di dottorato sulle Terme di Traiano sto lavorando ad una riproduzione digitale dell’antica Roma in 3D relativa al tardo II secolo d.C., ovvero post adrianea ma pre-severiana, assolutamente in low-poly e naturalmente di tipo esclusivamente “visuale”, da paesaggio, che possa fare da sfondo coerente con la proposta ricostruttiva relativa alle terme, centro focale del mio percorso di ricerca. Naturalmente si tratta di una quantità di edifici impressionante che non è possibile modellare tutti da solo, sebbene come detto in modo molto veloce. Il primo passo è la necessaria raccolta di informazioni bibliografiche dalle quali recuperare misure, piante, prospetti, sezioni, le migliori delle quali possono anche essere utilizzate come blue-prints, li digitalizzo attraverso una fotocamera ma ultimamente anche attraverso il sensore dello smartphone, sufficientemente risoluto (5MP); questo naturalmente introduce una serie di deformazioni non controllabili, in genere cerco di stare il più attento possibile affinché il disegno sia in piano e la camera sia ortogonale ad esso. In Photoshop una passata al “lens correction” consente di correggere matematicamente le distorsioni più evidenti, il free trasform in seguito può aiutare a raddrizzare ulteriormente le linee più ostiche: bisogna sempre essere coscienti che questo tipo di procedimento non è scientifico, ma il mio obiettivo è appunto soltanto visuale. Un controllo all’istogramma ed il file è pronto per essere importato in AutoCAD, dove un’opportuna scalatura mi consente di verificare il grado di accuratezza dei vari elementi: in base a quanto detto prima, può capitare che un angolo del foglio sia coerente ma l’angolo opposto no, in tal caso bisognerà fare attenzione e proprio per questo motivo a volte faccio la scalatura su elementi del disegno con misure note piuttosto che sulla scala metrica. Prima della vettorizalizzazione, preparo i layer in modo opportuno, generalmente distinguendo tra pianta, colonne, etc. e nel caso dei prospetti tra scalea, podio, tetto. In CAD mi limito al 2D, solo in casi particolari mi accingo a fare delle estrusioni per il calcolo dei volumi, solitamente utilizzando la proprità “spessore” delle polilinee chiuse, una modalità di tridimensionalizzare il disegno che mantiene il desktop operativo del programma molto leggero per la scheda video. Sono pronto: apro 3DS Max, attraverso il link manager collego  il disegno di AutoCAD al file di Max (modalità che mi consente di riflettere automaticamente qualsiasi modifica che faccio in CAD dentro 3DS), imposto i layer per il 3D e inizio a lavorare. È importante ricordarsi sempre di non toccare mai i layer collegati. Con lo snap vertex e gli oggetti line e box procedo a ricalcare gli elementi fondamentali della pianta/alzato in CAD a cui poi darò la corretta estrusione: come dicevo, le digitalizzazioni migliori possono essere usate come blue-prints, sfondi di modellazione che aiutano a lavorare l’elemento 3D in modo più rapido e preciso, quando magari ci sono degli elementi architettonici che richiedono una modellazione cosiddetta “organica”. Il resto fa parte della normale operatività del 3D, che non sto qui a spiegare, magari presentando un WIP del lavoro relativo al Teatro di Marcello, la cui immagine apre l’articolo. Mediamente si riesce a lavorare un monumento in 2 giorni, a seconda naturalmente della complessità richiesta. La difficoltà sarà mettere insieme tutti i vari elementi cercando di rimanere entro i 10.000.000 di poligoni (Rome Reborn nella seconda versione ha superato quota 9 milioni): lo saprete al Day of Archaeology 2013, quando il mio progetto di dottorato sarà appena concluso.English abstractThe digital era is very difficult today for an archaeologist: the most difficult consist in academia and university where the technologies and methodologies not are implemented yet. All over still remain at personal choiche of students, and a self-knowledge of it. Following the most important works of archaeologists and researcher around the world about Virtual Heritage, I promote this year the 3° seminar on Virtual Archaeology in Rome.For my PhD project I working on an low-poly and visual (not scientific) Ancient Digital Rome in 3D at the end of II century AD. Tipically, my lasts “Day of Archaeology” are as this: in library I search for update bibliography about the monuments, digitalized plants and other images for blue-prints, importing in AutoCAD to vectorialize it (using layer named correctly) in 2D. In 3DS Max I link the CAD file for 3D: also in 3DS I use new layer for tridimensional data. Naturally, the sequence of 3D is the normal sequence in computer graphic.

"260","A Day in Archaeology at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex, for this volunteer, means doing whatever is necessary to help the staff of the complex.This location consists of a mound built from 250 BC to 150 BC by Early Woodland Indians to honor three persons who held some position of regard in their culture, a museum which holds exhibits of the Adena culture of these Indians, and provides background of other West Virginia sites and Adena mounds.  Added to this is the history of efforts of modern man to preserve the Mound. A recent addition to the museum is the research complex which houses and archives artifacts found throughout the State of West Virginia and also archives reports and other written material relevant to prehistoric and historical archaeology for the State.I began volunteering two years ago after having retired from a social service agency here in West Virginia.  I have been interested in archaeology since I was 13, but at that time I thought it was done only in Egypt, so I put my energies into other studies.  It was unfortunate for me that as a teenager I was not aware that two very important archaeological sites (Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania and Grave Creek Mound in West Virginia) were within a 30-mile radius of my home, and if I had been born 10 years later (and had good vocational guidance), I may have had the opportunity to work on one of the sites as part of an undergraduate or graduate program.In my current volunteer experience I have done many things, the most important to me being work with the exhibits.  I have been doing data-entry of all the text in the core displays of the museum. The original intent of this effort was that by converting this information into digital form it would enable it to be accessible to those with vision impairment (as a social service worker, this was one population with which I became concerned).  To supplement the text, I would enter a description of the accompanying display.  I started this project nearly two years ago and I am still at it.There are two major secondary benefits to this project.  This information documents the exhibits which will be helpful for future work with exhibits and public programs.  Also, my having to read (and re-read) every single word of each display has familiarized me with the exhibit to such an extent that I am comfortable in providing an introduction to the museum for the visitors.Today three of us are working and it is a busy day in the summer. In my three hours here today, I am needed at the front desk, to greet visitors and help customers in the gift shop. I provide an orientation to the exhibits to 24 adults and 11 children, some coming individually and others in small groups. Some of these visitors came from Ohio, Virginia, Indiana, North Carolina,  Arkansas and Louisiana. In addition, 25 people came as part of a cub scout troop for an educational program and activities conducted by Andrea, the educator on staff.  After Andrea took the cub scouts and their adult leaders outside to do a demonstration, and then to try their hand in atlatl-throwing, the museum became quiet. I would have liked to have gone out to watch them — 8-12 year old competitive boys, doing something outside their normal activities. I enjoy watching young people learn about the Indians and archaeology, but a large group is difficult to manage — thank goodness for Andrea.I would advise anyone who has an interest in archaeology to volunteer at a place like this.  The staff is appreciative of the help and shows it by word and deed. They include me in many of their activities and conferences, so that I get hands-on experiences and hear presentations from experts in various fields of studies.   Having the opportunity to go through the exhibits on a weekly basis provides me with vastly more knowledge of the subject matter than anyone can hope to acquire in just occassional visits to the museum. The My Day at Grave Creek Mound by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"261","My name is Andrea Keller, and I am an archaeologist working as “cultural program coordinator” in museum education at the Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex in West Virginia, USA.When I was a kid, our family had a subscription to National Geographic. Every month, this magazine brought stories of fabulous people and places from faraway into our home. I decided early on that I wanted to be a jungle explorer. However, an article about Queen Nefertiti of Ancient Egypt gave my youthful interests a whole new direction.It turns out you don’t necessarily have to travel to remote places to learn about ancient cultures and how they lived their lives. While I have had the good fortune to have worked in Switzerland, Arizona, Illinois, and several other states in eastern and midwestern USA, I am now at home in West Virginia and discovering a rich archaeological heritage here. From early ice-age hunter-gatherers to hard-working industrial era folks, people have left their marks on the land and have left clues to their daily lives for us to ponder.Our facility is open on weekends;  it is my turn to work on Sundays but I have Fridays off. Since the official Day of Archaeology is on Friday, June 29, I will describe an actual working day, that is, Thursday, June 28.Working with the public, no two days are ever the same, and Thursday promises to be one of our busy days. We are expecting a group that consists of children and adult leaders from two local day care centers, who have reserved time for a guided tour of the museum and mound and one of our hands-on programs. Thursday evening we will also be hosting the June installment of our monthly lecture and film series. We usually feature speakers from other organizations, or films.  This evening, I will be presenting a slide show and leading a tour of our Interpretive Garden. Thursday, June 28Our work day starts at 9 am which is when the museum opens.  Some last minute preparations are to be made for the day care group.  They will arrive at 11 am to tour the mound and museum, eat a picnic lunch, and try out some replicas of prehistoric tools in our “Prehistoric Tools” program. I take out a trash can to the picnic area, and check the Activity Room where we will be experimenting with the replica tools. I set out corn for making corn meal on our grinding stones, and make sure the other tools are ready.It is a record-setting hot and dry June, so the next order of business is to water the Interpretive Garden.  I am hoping the garden will be looking O.K. for the program tonight.  The plants are getting stressed from the heat and lack of rain.  Our garden represents prehistoric Native American gardens in this region. It is partially based on archaeological information, and partially on historic accounts of Native American gardening techniques.  My favorite account is Buffalo Bird Woman’s Garden, by a Hidatsa woman who lived in North Dakota.  It is incredibly detailed, with precise instructions on how to plan, plant, and harvest a garden.  You can find her account on-line – it’s worth a look if you have an interest in Native American gardening.Watering the Interpretive Garden at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex At 10:30 am I am inside.  There is a little time to polish my slide show for the evening and start my write-up for the Day of Archaeology.  I get three sentences written for the latter, and my group is here. Time to hit ”save” and get the show on the road. The Day Care GroupThe group today is a day-care group consisting of children ages 2 – 13 years, a range of abilities that can be a challenge for a museum educator.   The Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex consists of several parts: the Grave Creek Mound and surrounding grounds which include the Interpretive Garden, the Delf Norona Museum (Delf Norona was a local historian and one of the founders of the West Virginia Archaeological Society), and the Research Facility.  The group will tour these areas with me.There is a majority of very young children in this group, so we skip the introductory slide show, and head out to the mound.  There are over 50 stone steps to climb to get to the top, and the adults and older kids help the smaller ones along. It’s quite a climb for those little legs!  At the top, we catch our breath.  Climbing to the top of the mound is exhausting even without carrying a load of dirt, as the people who built the mound did around 250-150 BC.  We look for familiar sights such as the Ohio River, Central Elementary School, and the old West Virginia Penitentiary, and wave at the adults with the kids in the strollers who are waiting below.  We look around, and consider how much effort it must have taken to build the mound.  Someone calculated that it took around 3 million loads of dirt, carried by hand. No bulldozers, wheelbarrows, or steel shovels!  Two main tombs were discovered in the mound during excavations back in 1838 – the whole monumental effort of building the Mound was done for three people.  What made these people, and this location worthy of such an investment in time and effort? Day Care Group at the Top of Grave Creek Mound The Day Care Group at the Interpretive Garden We head back down the mound, tie a loose shoe lace, and stop to take a look at the Interpretive Garden.Next it’s lunch time for the kids, and me, too.Time to check my e-mail, while I’m in the office.After lunch, we take a peek into the research lab viewing widow. We see a display of  drilled shells, a piece of elk antler, and chipped stones that were once part of hoes – perhaps similar to tools used to build the mound.  In the back of the room, we see the curators at work and wave at them.  They smile and wave back.  Heather takes our picture – you can see it on her Day of Archaeology post.  On the way out, we pass the Marble King exhibit, which is on loan from the West Virginia State Museum.  We run marbles through the exhibit’s marble machine – fun for kids of all ages!We continue our tour.  There are models of prehistoric homes, and a hunting scene.  One of the highlights is a model that shows the Grave Creek Mound being built.  Tiny model people are hard at work digging up soil and carrying it to the mound. There is a burial ceremony in progress on top of the mound, and daily tasks such as cooking and scraping a hide can be found by an observant eye.We enter the Activity Room, where we will do the “Prehistoric Tools” program.  I have set up three stations with replica tools.  There are sandstone abraders that are used to sharpen bone awls, grinding stones for making corn meal, and pump drills for making holes in pieces of wood.  The pump drills are a challenge for smaller hands, but with help from the adults and older kids, everyone gets the hang of it. The kids’ eyes light up when that pump drill is finally spinning and making a hole!  The goal is to drill a hole in a flat wooden shape to make a pendant.  Strings and colorful plastic beads are available for completing a stylish necklace.  I help one small girl tie her necklace and get a great big hug in return.  All to soon it is time for the group to say good bye. A chorus of “thank you” rings out and they are heading out the door.Corn GrindingPump Drill      Awl SharpeningTime to finish getting ready for the evening.Before heading upstairs, I check on the condition of the ladies’ rest room – looks OK.  John, our maintenance supervisor, has taken care of the trash from the picnic, which is very much appreciated!  I make more copies of our lecture/film series calendar so there are plenty available tonight.On the way to my office, I check on the museum’s Discovery Table, where small groups of visitors can make a craft to take home without having to sign up ahead of time. A family is making jewelry using beads made by rolling pieces of copper foil, our craft of the season.  I replenish the supply of copper blanks for making the beads.Family at Discovery TableShowing off Copper Bead Jewelry At 5:00 pm I go home for dinner, a shower, and a change of clothes.Evening ProgramI return at 6:30 pm. Time to start up the audio-visual equipment, and unlock the museum doors. It’s still oppressively hot outside, so we start with the slide show.  The subject is our Interpretive Garden, which we will tour later.  I take the opportunity to thank the many individuals who have helped with the garden: the horticulture students from our local John Marshall High School who prepared the garden back in April as well as volunteers and visitors who helped plant the garden in May.  We go outside, and walk around the garden discussing the plants.We had an early spring warming, and the larger plants grew from dropped seeds as “volunteers”. The smaller plants were planted May 20th, some even later when the first seeds did not grow. The corn is planted in small hills according to the traditional methods of some Native American gardeners. Beans will be planted when the corn is a little taller, and the weather becomes a little more hospitable to tender young seedlings.  The garden also contains pumpkins, squash and gourds, sunflowers, and goosefoot, also known as Chenopodium, lamb’s quarters, or spinach weed.  The people who built Grave Creek Mound probably were familiar with sunflowers, gourds, squash, and Chenopodium.  Corn and beans probably did not become used widely in our region until later, but their importance on later sites justifies including them in our garden.  It must have been an interesting time as people became more settled, and learned to grow a larger variety of plants.Examining Goosefoot Plant in Interpretive GardenThe garden looks exhausted in the summer sun.  Legend has it that corn, beans and squash are three sisters that live together in the garden. Tonight, sister squash’s leaves are drooping, and sister corn is curling up her long, pointed leaves.  Sister bean is still very young, and will need water very soon to survive. One of the men in the group volunteers to help water the garden.  His help will be greatly appreciated.We walk back to the museum in the last of the long summer evening light.  Time to lock up and head home. Thank you for sharing the “Day of Archaeology” with me.  If you should find yourself in our “neck of the woods”, please stop by and visit the Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex.You can learn more about the Complex and West Virginia Archaeology  by visiting the website of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History at www.wvculture.org.  You can also read posts by my colleagues here at Grave Creek and some of our wonderful, couldn’t-do-it-without-them volunteers and interns right here on the Day of Archaeology web site. The A Busy Day for an Archaeology Educator by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I sadly told him that I am not doing any more training until new funding comes in, but he can help with the review this summer. He is happy with that and popping his cv through our door on Monday.

Being married to a wood specialist, this rolled into an evening discussion at home about Anglo-Saxon coffins and boat fragments in graves etc… Damian is interested in seeing the iron ‘dogs’ or small clamps and nails which probably relate to burial furniture… (made note to myself – must twist his arm to come give a talk to the volunteers about his experience with Anglo-Saxon wood working and grave material in particular !!)In the Evening:Rob emailed me his Hands on the Past poster to advertise summer workshops we are planing to offer. He also created a new version of the warrior, with lengthened sword & scabbard + inlay added to spearhead (this gave me the idea that we should produce a “spot the Difference” book of  Rob’s drawings – before and after being tweeked by specialists’ corrections).  He also mocked up the design for the first of our line of ‘Rob Bloomfield for CSI ‘Tees…Advertisement for upcoming workshops at CSIRob Bloomfield for CSI: SittingbourneAnd this brings us to the close of reporting on another full and diverse day at CSI: Sittingbourne. The End of the Day at CSI: Sittingbourne by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

We wanted to get a higher degree because we wanted to have a family at some time in the future. At the time we made the choice of coming to UCLAN, we were working in the field for a CRM company in California. Although we were not completely unhappy, it was time for a change. We had been field technicians for about five years, had not had a home in two as we were in near constant ten day rotations. When not working we would visit and stay with family. While working our house became the contents of two large blue totes and a red roller suitcase of books placed in exactly the same way in every hotel room we lived in. Life was good (we even had annual passes to Disneyland and would work a full day and have dinner and a ride at night) but we wanted to one day have a family as well. So we finally accepted the invitation from a colleague to study at the university he worked for. Equating more education with a more stable position in archaeology.Why the background story? It’s important, as on the 29th of June during the Day of Archaeology, archaeology was but one aspect of my identity (a theme in my PhD).Almost half way through the MSc and right before I was to start my field work last year, we discovered our future dreams of a family were to happen a whole lot sooner. I gave birth to my son in November, a couple of weeks after I graduated from my Masters. In January I started the PhD.My Day of Archaeology consisted of:General email round-up from the school email system to see if I have succeeded through Progression and Registration for my degree with the university. (Can’t forget about Facebook as a tool to keep in touch with family, friends, and old colleagues.)Taking my son to Baby Club at the local Sure Start Centre. See how I include in my day attendance of a social group event, but have completely completely disregarded the countless minutes of my domestic work as a mother including cooking, cleaning, baby care (and those loads of nappies, expressing breast milk, and new baby solids which I made not bought). Maybe as archaeologist we fail to think and look at the mundane as we see it as too everyday, but it is the everyday rituals that show my identity in the archaeological record. Just something to think about, as I think about it more and more every day. What are the mundane things we miss as archaeologist that are / were actually so important to peoples in the past?While my son takes naps in the afternoon I TRY and read for my literature review. Today it was Vicki Bell’s edited volume Performativity and Belonging. I am particularly inspired by Anne-Marie Fortier’s article “Re-Membering Places and the Performance of Belonging(s).” The biggest bit of archaeology today was writing an abstract to present an oral presentation at the Theoretical Archaeological Group (TAG) for the 2012 Liverpool conference, on my work on developing an Archaeology of Belonging. It will be the first major conference in which I will be an oral presenter. I am a mix of excited and very nervous.As I said: I am an archaeologist. But I am also a PhD researcher, a wife, and a mother. The Not Just an Archaeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"265","Hello and welcome to my post!  My name is Annie and I one of the lucky few who are undertaking a Community Archaeology Training Placement being offered by the Council for British Archaeology and I’m doing it with Canterbury Archaeological Trust.  Here’s a link to the CBA web-site where there is more information on the placements, the project is set to continue for a few more years so do keep an eye out if you are interested in signing up!Anyway, down to business and I’ll start with a quick run down of the project.  A Town Unearthed: Folkestone before 1500 is a 3 year community project centred around uncovering Folkestone’s rich and varied history through a variety of activities including archaeological excavation, lectures, school visits, events, talks, forums, and exhibitions (to name but a few!) with volunteers taking a lead in organising, stewarding, and generally making things happen.  The project is in it’s final year and I have been tasked with being in charge of the archaeology side of things which is where our Day of Archaeology day comes in….…Last year the archaeology side of the project centred around a Roman Villa which is tragically falling off the edge of a cliff (estimates are predicting the whole site will be gone in 50 years).  The Villa was uncovered and open to the public from the 1920s-1950s when post-war austerity forced it’s closure and it was re-buried until the 1980s when some archaeologists went in to see how much was being lost; since then more has gone over and it was decided to open it up to have another look.  Around 200 people from Folkestone had a go at excavating the site over 3 months, with plenty more dropping in to have a look, and the results were surprising. Only a portion of the Villa was re-excavated and produced some fantastic finds of the period, but more exciting perhaps was the discovery of a large Iron Age settlement beneath the floors of the Villa.  This settlement appeared to be industrial in nature, as a large number of quern stones, made from the local Green Stone found on the beach below, were discovered, and have been found in the gardens of the houses surrounding the area (many of them now making up attractive fireplaces and rockeries!); some were even incorporated into the fabric of the Roman Villa.  This year we are not returning to the Villa site but are instead test pitting in the gardens of the houses near to the site in the hope of picking up some Roman or Iron Age features to establish the extent of the site.  On our Day of Archeology day we were mid-excavation in our first ‘pit’ and I’m going to give you a insight into how I like to involve my volunteers on community projects.So our day starts and we immediately pick up where we left off on the previous day with everyone getting stuck in with the trowels…We find an interesting green patch of clay, which turned out to be a very unexciting modern dumping episode…..we persevere……giving the trench a quick scan with the metal detector……and come up with a bullet! We also had two coins (possibly Roman) and a few buttons which may have been from military uniforms. Folkestone played a large part in both the First and Second World wars and to find evidence for this is very exciting for me…..and finally starting the recording. I’m a big believer in volunteers getting involved in all aspects of archaeology, including the paperwork, so if you ever end up on one of my sites I will torture you with it..…and there we have it, a day of community archaeology with a fantastic bunch of people who I’d like to thank for their hard work and dedication to the project. Although this particular test pit did not produce any Roman or Iron Age features we had a lot of pottery from the period so I’m satisfied. We’ll be test pitting all through the summer. I am blogging about my placement so if you’d like to have a look at what I’ve been up to, or want to keep up to date on this project then here’s the link.Thanks for reading!  The A Town Unearthed: Folkestone Before 1500 – Community & Archaeology. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"266","My name is Dr. Elizabeth Moore and I am the Curator of Archaeology at the Virginia Museum of Natural History. Virginia has been seeing some unseasonably high temperatures so fieldwork is not a viable option these days for many of my volunteers. The 2012 Day of Archaeology saw a high of 104 degrees F. It’s a good day to be in the lab.Today I am examining an assemblage that recently came into the museum from an interesting site in southwest Virginia. The site had a very light scatter of recent materials on the surface and a single buried Native American ceramic vessel. Carbon residue dates the vessel to ca. A.D.1,200. Inside the vessel was an assortment of botanical materials including wild bean, wild grape, wild blueberry, and corn. Corn in Virginia first dates to ca. A.D.1,100 so the corn in this vessel is fairly early for this part of the world. I have been sorting through the bagged flotation samples to see if there is enough corn to get a direct date using AMS on the corn itself. So far the only fragments I have seen are very small but there are still a couple of bags to go so maybe we’ll get lucky.Some of the flotation samples I am searching for corn remains. The In Search of Corn by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The aim was to promote Archaeology in a bid to attract more students and at the same time to demystify the subject, since it is common for people to enrol in the course having a wrong idea about it, usually linking it with movie characters, like Indiana Jones. On the Day of Archaeology, apart from the talk, some archaeological artefacts were shown, and copies of rock art panels were displayed. We intend to make it a regular activity for the undergraduates, since it is an excellent opportunity for them to develop important skills, such as public speaking, and also to make Archaeology more widely known.The Meeting with Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"268","Hi, I‘m Gillian Ramsay a human osteoarcheology graduate volunteering at Abbot House with the collections and education programmes. We are currently in the process of planning an exhibition for the late autumn/early winter which will celebrate 20 years since the first excavations were carried out at Abbot House. In 1992 a series of excavations were conducted by Fife Council before the building was renovated and transformed into Abbot House Heritage Centre. The excavation found evidence of occupation on the site stretching back to the 12th century, including workshops, stables and a late medieval graveyard. At the beginning of 2013 a new excavation conducted by Fife Council will start on an area of land right beside Abbot House. The excavation will prepare for the construction of a new Dunfermline Museum. The aim of our exhibition is to show the public what was found during previous digs, and to excite them about archaeology in general and about discoveries that might be made during the new excavation.The Archaeology Exhibition is all part of our new renovation and rejuvenation scheme for Abbot House. We are trying to encourage local people to visit the house more often with a series of family events, night- and day-time lectures, and rotating exhibitions. In intention is that by 2014 the house will have been completely renovated, bringing the exhibits and facilities right up to date, with more hands-on interactive exhibits and engaging displays aimed at all ages.The exhibition will display a number of the artefacts found at the sight within the context of what they can tell us about life in medieval and early modern Dunfermline. The majority of the artefacts will be loaned from Fife Council, although the displays will also include finds from Abbot House’s own collection. Abbot House has a small collection in storage on the property. The artefacts had been placed in boxes in the attic and forgotten about for 20 years so in preparation for the exhibition we brought them out of the attic, washed, catalogued, bagged and tagged the finds, and placed them in more suitable boxes.As part of the exhibition we are considering having a stratigraphy display depicting the levels of activity at the site, with objects from the excavation placed within their respective horizons. So on the Day of Archaeology we began by going through the collection housed at Abbot House looking for artefacts for each layer.Abbot House also runs a successful schools programme called Step into Medieval Dunfermline, which includes a mock excavation where kids can dig for finds and record them. On Wednesday a visiting school group managed to find all the objects in record time— so we thought it might be best to bury a few more artefacts! In the afternoon we selected a few more child-friendly and durable artefacts from the collection to bury in the dig pits. For more information on Abbot House, the archaeology exhibition this autumn, our schools programme, or any of our other events, Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter (@abbothouse), log onto our website, or give us a ring at 01383 733 266.

Ambrosetti”. Es un museo universitario (depende de la Facultad de Filosofía y Letras de la Universidad de Buenos Aires) que cumple funciones de investigación, difusión y educación, enfocado en antropología y arqueología. Nuestras exhibiciones hablan sobre temáticas vinculadas a los pueblos originarios del actual territorio argentino y de otras partes del mundo.Soy educadora y guía en el Programa de Público General del Área de Extensión Educativa del Museo. Allí, me encargo de dar visitas guiadas en español e inglés, organizar eventos y actividades culturales y ayudar en el armado de la gráfica para difundir las actividades, entre otras tareas. ¿Qué es lo que hice este viernes, en mi Día de Arqueología? Mucho, aunque no siempre relacionado con la disciplina: fue un día de gestión, diseño y difusión y mucho trabajo en equipo: pensando en niños, redes sociales y medios de comunicación. Lo más rápido del día:¿Alguna vez vieron en televisión esos concursos en que los participantes deben gastar una cierta cantidad de dinero en un corto tiempo? La buena noticia es que nosotros sabemos qué debemos comprar y averiguamos de forma anticipada los mejores precios: pero una vez que tenemos el dinero, ¡hay que correr!¿La misión? Comprar todos los materiales necesarios para Vacaciones de Invierno 2012 (actividades especiales dirigidas a niños de 5 a 12 años en su receso escolar invernal, del 14 al 29 de julio): desde lápices de colores hasta maquillaje artístico y un maniquí. Mi gran dolor de cabeza:Terminar de diseñar los volantes y el póster para difundir las Vacaciones de Invierno 2012: soy (casi) arqueóloga: no soy diseñadora ni artista gráfica. Lograr que nuestra difusión se vea atractiva, llamativa y que, a la vez, contenga toda la información que queremos brindar, puede ser motivo de frustraciones… y de grandes satisfacciones cuando todo sale bien.Vacaciones de Invierno 2012 en el Museo (flyer) Lo que llevó más tiempo:Subir una videocomunicación acerca de nuestro trabajo como educadores, para participar de un congreso virtual de museos y educación en España. Lo que pensamos sería fácil se complicó: por muchos problemas de conectividad, subir un video de 10 minutos me llevó ¡más de 20 horas!Lo más esperado:Armar la página de Facebook del Museo, para compartir y difundir nuestras actividades. ¡Algo que venimos planificando desde hace mucho, mucho tiempo!El museo Etnográfico está en Facebook (poster) La sorpresa:Me tocó recibir a un periodista y su equipo de filmación (de un canal privado de televisión por cable) que quería conocer y difundir al Museo entre su audiencia. Los acompañé por tres de las exhibiciones, hablando de nuestra historia, los objetos, las investigaciones y las visitas guiadas que realizamos: un recorrido de 40 minutos que tienen que reducir a sólo 8 minutos: ¿la magia de la televisión?Y como la vida no termina en el Museo…Cuando llegué a casa, me puse a trabajar en más diseño gráfico.

"270","Things move fast in archaeology, major discoveries are made that can transform our perceptions of the past and its relation to us, a perfect example being the Neanderthal genome in 2010. My own situation as an archaeologist has changed dramatically from 2011′s Day of Archaeology, and this is what I’ve chosen to write about for 2012: what happens when you’ve been doing archaeology for half your life, but have to step away from it full-time? I hope my experience can give people a more realistic idea of the benefits and risks of pursuing your archaeological dream…Last year I wrote about the Quaternary Archaeology and Environments of Jersey project, which I was working with as a late Neanderthal archaeology specialist. Although the project is still going from strength to strength (and started 2012 fieldwork officially today, on a probably rather soggy Jersey), I will not be there this summer to enjoy the delights of stone tool collections, the La Cotte site and the sponsorship of the Liberation Brewery.Geoff Smith and me working on La Cotte material for the QAEJ project in 2011. Photo by Alison Lewis.Like many others finishing their PhD since 2008, I’ve struggled to get research funding or a paid academic position. Despite gaining a clutch of prizes during my undergraduate years including best dissertation (on the missing Mesolithic of Shropshire, with own fieldwalking, test pitting and aerial photography survey), full AHRB funding for my MA and a coveted University Research Scholarship for my PhD, I’ve realized that exceptional academic calibre isn’t enough anymore to gain a foothold for a research career.The ‘Post-Doc’ world has become ever more challenging over the past decade, with some truly horrifying statistics. Only a third of UK science PhDs get postdoc positions, while only 4% manage to secure a permanent academic position. Arts PhDs aren’t in a better position either, and in addition lack the obvious career transition to STEM industry jobs. The reality is that there are too many PhDs being produced, including in archaeology. While I was at Sheffield, there were 50 PhDs registered. I haven’t seen anywhere near that number of research jobs or funding possibilities over the past two years since I finished my PhD; there is simply not enough opportunity out there to meet the postdoc output of even one department! I’ve been lucky enough for the past year to be supported by University of Manchester with an Honorary Research Fellowship, that allows me to remain part of a department and benefit from the network of very active and supportive researchers there. However, Honorary = unpaid, and this position of trying to publish, attend conferences, network with colleagues, and work unpaid on projects is one many of my fellow graduates are in.At the first ESHE conference in 2011, giving a poster on my PhD research. Photo by Elinor CroxallUniversities pressure staff within departments to keep taking on new PhDs as it boosts their research rankings, yet there is virtually no open discussion of the possibility of failing to forge an academic career after your doctorate (and it generally IS regarded as a failure). Then there are the perennial issues of vast disparities in quality of PhD supervision, with no system in place for assessing performance in this area, despite the support and advice received during your PhD being vital to your success afterwards. Everyone eventually comes to realize that an impressive publication list is what will get you noticed for postdoc funding and academic job interviews, yet many PhD are discouraged from publishing during their time as students (or even from speaking at conferences) by supervisors who fear repercussions if theses are submitted “late” (after more than three years).Despite coming very close to getting postdoctoral funding (I almost won a Marie Curie Fellowship to work at University of Bordeaux), after two years without any income beyond occasional expenses for working on field projects, I’ve had to take the difficult decision to shift my path out away from an archaeological research career. I needed to bring in some income to my household, and frankly I was getting very dispirited by repeated disappointments of funding rejections etc. In January 2012 I decided not to apply for the next round of postdoctoral fellowships (with success rates of 3-7%!), or try again for a Marie Curie that would require me to live away from my husband for two years, just after I’d got used to a home life after eight years of degrees in three different cities.Instead I’ve upped the hours I was already working in non-archaeological jobs, and started to get a bit ‘leftfield’ in trying to keep archaeology in my life. Through my Honorary Research Fellowship at Manchester, I’ve been running Discover Archaeology workshops with young people aged 13-17 at the University, giving them an idea of why studying archaeology is relevant to them. This has been a lot of fun, and involved practical sessions on getting to grips with artefacts (animal bones, pot sherds, flints), as well as getting them to think a bit more deeply about things like the archaeology of death and how this can widen your understanding of diverse practices ongoing today. The sessions take quite a bit of preparation, and are very intensive, but are really rewarding. It’s always great seeing young people’s faces light up as they identify a beaver skull (“it’s kind of like a big rat”) or work out the relative ages of different pots. However, these workshops aren’t regular, and I receive barely more than minimum wage for running them (including preparation time). I would like to do more of this kind of work with schools, and I hope to make some connections soon with existing organizations who might like to have a Neanderthal specialist on the team (everyone knows kids love them, right?!).Another exciting possibility for keeping the archaeology flame burning in my life has also developed since the start of 2012. I post on Twitter as @LeMoustier, and have found it a fabulous way to interact with many very cool archaeologists across the world. Additionally, I’m into birding in my spare time, and have connected with quite a lot of people in that sphere too. Following a tweet I posted on cave art, I got into conversation with @chiffchat, who turned out to be a Senior Commissioning Editor for Bloomsbury Press, and was just looking for the right person to write a book on cave art, prehistory and birds… Following a great trip to London to meet @chiffchat (aka Jim Martin), where we bonded over lunch and Neanderthals, yesterday Bloomsbury officially announced their acquisition of “Dawn Chorus in Eden: Humanity and Birds in Prehistory”, by Rebecca Wragg Sykes, coming 2014! So I will be working on this book part time over the next two years, trying to communicate my passion for prehistoric archaeology, especially the Palaeolithic, through describing how birds have been part of the human story from the beginning. It’s not a full-time archaeology job, but it allows me to keep doing something I love, and get paid for it.Heron from a birding trip: you never know how archaeology might fit into your life!I want to finish this Day of Archaeology post on a positive note. I’ve been doing archaeology since I was 14, on work experience digging at Fishbourne Roman Palace. It’s part of who I am in a fundamental way as it is for almost all the archaeologists I know, it’s shaped me, given me incredible experiences (and a husband!). I don’t regret doing my PhD, but those considering a career in archaeological research should not be under any illusions of employment afterwards. I didn’t have an official career Plan B, and I might have done a lot differently with hindsight if I had. But if archaeology is your passion, there’s ways and means to keep on *being* an archaeologist, although it might involve a little lateral thinking and maybe getting yourself on Twitter!Trowel my undergrad friends gave for for graduationThe Once an Archaeologist…?

"271","We set up the Folkestone Research and Archaeology Group in January this year, having met on a recent dig in the area. Realising that there was no local group in existence, we set about creating one. Since we started, we have engaged in a number of activities and also hold monthly meetings. We decided that a regular newsletter would update any of our members who were unable to join in some of the activites and also to help promote our group to anyone who is interested.Our editor composed our first newsletter, and on The Day of Archaeology, a few of us met up to finalise the content for distribution the next day.  We also had a good chin-wag over upcoming events. The newsletter can now be viewed on our website here.A day later, one of our members came up with the bright idea of taking a walk “up the downs” (dont you just love that term?) on Sunday. Other than being a bit of a social event, we also wanted to explore the locations of a number of barrows that we may be able to excavate at a later date.  As usual, the bright sunny day (as predicted by the weather forecasters) turned out to be “unsettled”, with us having to wait for the heavy showers to abate before setting off.Walking over the downs, we located a number of the barrows we were looking for, whilst also enjoying the views. We covered the area we wanted to explore, with intermittent sunny spells and rain showers. We then noticed some black clouds ominously advancing towards us, so took the shortest route (the road) back to the pub, with cattle racing along in the field next to us, also trying to avoid the oncoming storm. Thankfully, we made it back, just in time, before the rain and hail began their assault.  Over a Guinness, our chairman had a quick chat with the pub landlord about conducting a dig in their beer garden, whilst the rest of us discussed the training dig we have starting in a member’s garden this coming weekend.  It looks like we could be a busy group in the near future.Escaping the storm clouds and the deluge to come The Folkestone Research & Archaeology Group: Finalising our First Newsletter & Exploring the Downs by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Chloe will now start her assessment of how the landscape has changed over time and what archaeology could exist in the area.Enhancing records © Wessex ArchaeologySophie Thorogood, Marine Archaeologist, is busy working on the final report for the South East Rapid Coastal Zone Assessment. This is an English Heritage project, which aims to enhance the archaeological records of the National Monuments Record, local Historic Environment Records and Sites and Monuments Records, and to serve as a basis for improved management of the coastal historic environment.Marine GeophysicsThe marine geophysics team are busy interpreting sidescan data from the field.  Sidescan is a type of geophysical survey that measures the intensity of soundwaves reflected off the seafloor.  These experts can assess if the sidescan shows natural or man-made features. If man-made they could indicate the location of a wreck. Their work is very technical and complicated – illustrated by the complex combination of computer screens required. How many computer screens does one person need?

"275","Hello, my name is Cara Jones and work for Archaeology Scotland, as the Adopt-a-Monument Project Officer. Adopt-a-Monument is a five year scheme which supports and facilitates local archaeology groups who wish to conserve and promote their local heritage. The scheme is community led and we work through-out Scotland – from Shetland to Dumfries and Galloway. In addition to our more traditional projects, we are also funded to do outreach projects – taking archaeology to non-traditional heritage audiences.My Day of Archaeology post is about one of our Adopt-a-Monument outreach projects – The Claypits. In 2011, Adopt-a-Monument was contacted by the Friends of Possil Park to see if we could help with their greenspace improvement initiative for an area of apparent waste land in central Glasgow. Flanked by the Forth Clyde canal, the area has a industrial past, linked to the development of Glasgow in the 18th and 19th century. On first impression, the Claypits does look like an un-inviting, littered and burnt out car dump kind of place – the type of place you avoid and definitely not a space where you would enjoy and appreciate. However, once you start to work there, get to know the local people and start researching the past and present use of the site, Claypits transforms into a valuable greenspace within urbanised landscape. I enjoy many things about this project, but one great aspect is that isn’t just about archaeology – we are working in collaboration with ecologists (it’s a great newt and frog site!), artists, a lovely local councillor, fishermen (Get Hooked on Fishing – a great youth engagement project), canoeists, mountain bikers, the local allotment association, Scottish Canals and the Waterways Trust. I’m sure I’ve missed someone out, but it is a great example of successful partnership working.Team meeting before the event startsBut I digress! My Day of Archaeology was the ‘Bats, Beasties and Buried Treasure’ event, held at the Claypits on the 30th June 2012. Aimed at local people (and in particular local families) the open day encourages the use and enjoyment of their local greenspace. We ran several activities which included the dig box and ancient crafts, a treasure hunt and storytelling – all linked to the archaeology and local history of the area.(The Dig box!) Situated at ‘Base Camp’, the dig box contained replica finds (cattle bone, shell, beads, burnt pot, bone comb etc) which (after discovery) we encourage each child to think like an archaeologist – ‘what do these finds tell us about this location?’, ‘What would we find if we excavated your front room’ – introducing the concept of material culture within a context they understand. Next to the dig box we also had grinding activities (both a replica saddle quern and rotary quern) where children could grind grain into flour, which they could then take away with them. We also had a ‘make your own Neolithic pot’ areas, where children can make a small pinch pot and try and copy groove ware decorations.Neolithic pot making!We also organised a treasure hunt – developed by Kate (our placement from Newcastle University) who buried objects which relate to the past use of the site (some old brick from the iron foundry, an old milk bottle from quarry). While guiding them through the site, Kate encouraged children to find the object and then try and think about why the object was there and how it relates to the past use of the landscape. Our storytelling activity did the same thing – Erin (our crack storyteller) developed stories around the local history of the site and surrounding area. Her stories ranged from the time local football club Partick Thistle beat Celtic 4:1 in 1971, to a story about a young girl who disguised herself as a man to work in the quarry on the site at the time of the building of the canal. Storytelling is for us, a new way of disseminating the archaeological and historical background of the site and something we hope to develop further as Adopt-a-Monument goes on.Erin and her storytelling hour!Of the 100 to 130 visitors to the site on the day, 59 children took part in our activities, which, taking into account we didn’t have canoes or newts to attract children is not bad going!Team Archaeology Scotland!   The Adopt-a-Monument by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"276","I’ve just begun a Community Heritage project with two local schools that are merging (Bramble’s Nursery and Children’s Centre and Goldsmith’s Infant School). The Day of Archaeology was my first day of fieldwork. Bramble’s was built in 1888 as an Infant school; Goldsmith’s was built in 1966 on the site of the Boys and Girls School which had accompanied the Infant School in 1888. Although the two schools work closely together, they have different structures, concerns, history. The merger has advantages but it will be a big change and the Heritage project is intended to support that change process by allowing people to focus on the changes the schools have gone through already, to provide a point of reflection in that process.One of the real joys of this project is the excitement of the schools for the work. All of the people I’ve dealt with so far have been really happy to share memories, show me their buildings and find great archival material. They are also really comfortable with the idea that the heritage of the 1966 building is as important as the 1888 building; that the heritage is more than the buildings; that the previous schools are part of the story. Most of all they are keen to see heritage as all about change.We are not recording these buildings because they, or some of their features will be lost (though they may be). We are not trying to preserve the sites, or any of their heritage. We are using their heritage as a source of strength in a time of change. Which is what I always wanted archaeology to be about.A lot of the project involves Oral History (listening to people) and Archival Research (working with official documents like log books for the school). But on the Day of Archaeology I spent my time getting to know the buildings as an archaeologist. I already know the buildings as a parent. My son went to Brambles at 6 months old and is finishing his second year at Goldsmith’s. What’s so different about an archaeologist’s eye that I needed to do this work at all?Every archaeologist is different, and every project has different aims, but for me and these schools the archaeologists gaze is about looking for the manifestations of change. Some may be big changes (like the plaque commemorating the building of Goldsmiths) Some may be smaller (the slight differences in the build of the staff room marking it as a later addition) some may be tiny (the holes drilled in the brickwork holding something now removed, or even the wear on the pavement in the new playground). I spent the day noticing these, noting them, photographing them and thinking about them. They are the raw materials which materialise the stories that the other aspects of the project are beginning to frame.I can’t resist one of these stories which I can only see the edges of so far, as told by this piece of unbuilt heritage – a plan of the site from 1943. You can see the Boys, Girls, and Infants schools, and the gender/age divided playgrounds, walls, boundaries, doors and drainage all present. Except the school was bombed in 1941. In 1943 only the Infant School was still standing and it wasn’t in use. Most of the site was an uncleared bombsite What hoped for future does this plan represent? How does it reflect the schools that were bombed (which I can’t find a plan for yet)? And how can I use it as a thread in a heritage that supports a new future for these schools?The Back to School by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"277","My name is Angus Forshaw and I am the Community Archaeologist Trainee at Wessex Archaeology.  This years ‘Day of Archaeology’ found me out on site, excavating a Bronze Age Barrow and Anglo-Saxon cemetery on Salisbury Plain.  I was working alongside soldiers from the Rifles regiments who are excavating the site over six weeks as part of ‘Operation Nightingale’.Site Briefing, I am the one holding the site map © Wessex ArchaeologyOperation Nightingale is a pilot project established by Sergeant Diarmaid Walshe of the 1st Battalion The Rifles and Richard Osgood, Senior Historic Advisor of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO). The project aims to meet a demand amongst wounded soldiers for viable rehabilitation programmes, in this case utilising heritage primarily through learning field archaeology skills. You can find out more at www.opnightingale.co.uk.Wessex Archaeology has worked with Operation Nightingale on several projects this year and the current excavations are just the next part of a this successful and innovative project.Having camped overnight with the soldiers my day started with a good fried breakfast, along with discussions on how Roman pottery found the previous day had found its way into our ditch fill.  We were soon out on site, continuing with our areas of excavation.  Trench Two saw the lion’s share of work with a number of Anglo-Saxon Skeletons being uncovered and excavated.  Along with those already in progress today saw the discovery of two more grave cuts taking the total graves found to seven.  The lifting of one of these provided us with our first grave goods with three amber beads found much to the excitement of everyone on site.Excavating a skeleton © Wessex ArchaeologyOver in Trench One we continued digging into the barrow ditch where graves were found in Trench Two.   Unfortunately, all to be found so far has been a maze of badger burrows, but who knows what we may find in the coming weeks.So that’s the goings on up on site on the ‘Day of Archaeology’.  An exciting end to week two of excavations.

"278","My day started with a train journey, during which I read the National Planning Policy Framework or NPPF for short. The NPPF deals with government policy on planning and was published following the localism bill last year.I arrived at work and headed over to the venue for my NPPF training session. Having only been in my current job for a month or so I spend quite a lot of time in training. The session was really useful, pointing out the similarities with and differences from the previous policy of PPS5 (Planning Policy Statement 5). We focused on references to heritage assets and archaeology.Over lunch I did a bit of research online, as at the weekend some friends had mentioned they were planning to visit the Museum of London and I had suggested they take a look at the Floral Street brooch (warning blatant self-promotion) as I had been the finder of this artefact during my days as a field archaeologist. I was pleased to find it is still on display so I sent them a link.  After lunch I caught up on correspondence, as I had been on holiday the previous two days. My job involves being asked many questions by commercial archaeologists, I don’t always know the answers but usually one of the other eight science advisors does. The first question was about lipid analysis of pottery. This is a technique whereby food residues on the inner surface of ceramic vessels and material that has been absorbed by the ceramics can be analysed to identify the type of fat present. Having ascertained that three university departments carried out such work I was able to get back to the archaeologist with the information quickly.My next task was some preparation and arrangements for a meeting of the PZG, the Professional Zooarchaeology Group coming up on the 14th July.This organisation was set up in 2005 with the aim of helping zooarchaeologists (animal bone specialists) from academic and commercial spheres to meet for support and exchange of ideas, techniques etc. Whilst working in commercial archaeology both as an employee and later as a freelance specialist I found the PZG an invaluable resource. Part of the upcoming meeting is the discussion of draft guidelines for animal bone work within commercial archaeology.The latter part of my day was spend doing admin tasks, logging my time for the previous week, and checking details for the staff conference in Warwick which starts tomorrow.My train journey home was just long enough to read, Life and death in London’s East End: 2000 years at Spitalfields. This was an excellent read aimed at a wide audience but delivered fascinating detail on the work done. I would recommend it to both professional archaeologists and all those interested in archaeology.  The Sylvia Warman: English Heritage Science Advisor (London) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"279","My name is Angel Green and I am an Anthropology major at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York.  It has been a lifelong dream of mine to work as an archaeologist in the field and this summer I fulfilled that dream.  I am one of ten students participating in the Binghamton University Archaeology Field School 2012.  This experience has not only opened my eyes to the wonderful intrigues and strenuous tedium of archaeology, but has also enlightened me on my strength as a woman in the field and has helped illuminate my future path as an archaeologist.This year the field school is conducting excavations at a local site call John Moore Farm.  This site has yielded fascinating information about prehistoric Native American settlement patterns from approximately 1500 B.C., a time known as the Transitional Period here in the Northeastern United States.  John Moore Farm is located on the banks of the Susquehanna River and Native Americans used this site for seasonal camps.  Our focus is to recover as much information from this site as we can before the City of Binghamton constructs a pedestrian/bicycle walkway on top of the site.A day in my life as an archaeologist at John Moore Farm begins with lots of sun screen and bug spray.  The site does not offer any shade and the banks of a river is a lovely home to many creepy crawly creatures.  It is very green and lush here in Binghamton and most of our test units are dug in the midst of a poison ivy forest.  All inconveniences aside, with trowel proudly in hand, I dug and toiled with the best of them.We have opened 18 test units during the past six weeks here at John Moore Farm.  I have personally dug into four of them and have discovered exciting bits and pieces of history.  Currently, we have uncovered several prehistoric hearths that can be identified by a cache of fire cracked rock, charcoal and reddened soils.  Also, throughout the site we have found the tiny remnants of flintknapping.  Flintknapping is the ancient process of making stone tools and this process leaves behind distinct tiny flakes of stone material.  These materials have included chert, jasper, and rhyolite.  Steatite, commonly known as soapstone, is another material found at the site and was used by Native Americans in the region for carving vessels.  The chert is a local material, but the jasper, rhyolite and steatite are non-local and this offers interesting glimpses into the trade patterns of ancient Native Americans.  We get very excited when one of our team digs up an actual stone tool such as an arrowhead.  It is common to find the minute traces of the stone that was chipped away while making an arrowhead, but the Native Americans usually took the complete arrowheads with them when they left the camps so finding one still at the site thousands of years later is a real treat for us.  All ‘cool’ and unique artifacts found will immediately make the rounds among the students which, in turn, receive excited gasps and intrigued praise.  Archaeologists find happiness in the little things.The Day of Archaeology in Binghamton, New York by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"280","Tamira here, Research Archaeologist with the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS). I currently serve as a Site Supervisor at the East St. Louis Mound site, one of the largest Mississippian period (AD 1000-1450) sites in the pre-Columbian world, just downstream from Cahokia Mounds. Large-scale excavations have been ongoing at East St. Louis since 2008 in advance of the construction of a new bridge that will span across the Mississippi river from Illinois to Missouri. This project involves more than just the bridge though – it includes new utilities, interchanges, road realignments and improvements, and the diversion of an interstate from its current route to the new bridge. A large portion of this project’s footprint impacts the site. It’s our job to recover as much information as possible from this portion of East. St. Louis before construction takes place.This bridge project requires LOT of work from a lot of different groups. ISAS works with all of these groups on a daily basis in order to ensure that this important project runs safely and with efficiency. Just like the many other groups working on this project, we have deadlines that must be met so that the bridge will open as scheduled in 2014. Unlike those contractors however, we really never know what lies ahead on any given day – which is one of the most exciting parts of being an archaeologist. We could be faced with rock hard soil or sloppy mud depending on the weather or enjoy a perfect day of sunshine; be completely shut out of an area due to another contractor’s schedule or finish an area ahead of time; spend hours digging finding nothing but dirt or discover an amazing artifact that will help rewrite the history of the site. These factors make a large part of the job a balancing act between maximizing data recovery and doing top notch research while meeting the demands of the larger project. Luckily, we have a hard-working crew of more than 80 individuals who rise to meet the challenge day after day. Our team includes not only the excavators and supervisors on site, but essential staff in the office who make our maps, write reports, curate finds, coordinate with native groups, and make sure that our research both reaches both the scientific and public communities.My particular role at ISAS shifts depending on the needs of the project. Until recently, I spent my days running one of the many excavation blocks at the site – supervising crew, interpreting features, making sure that paperwork is done properly, coordinating with supervisors in other areas of the site, and deciding what’s to be done next among other tasks. The job requires a great deal of flexibility, problem solving, and people skills. I worked in this capacity until the day that my daughter, Orin was born. This came with particular challenges – working through morning sickness, an increasing need to visit the port-a-john as the due date approached, and navigating my baby-bump in tight excavation areas – but the most unexpected challenge was probably finding field-appropriate clothing for the expectant archaeologist! Try a Google search of “maternity work wear” and you’ll see what I mean. Despite these minor obstacles, a healthy pregnancy allowed me to enjoy my entire pregnancy in the field, and there’s no place I would have rather been!I returned to work from my maternity leave just last week and am now active on the next stage of the project – analysis and write-up. My day to day involves checking over notes and maps from the field, examining the artifacts – which includes anything from the refuse of daily life such as pottery and chipped stone to exotic and unusual items, interpreting finds, and most importantly, pulling all of this information together so that it can be written up and presented in a cohesive report. For a project of this scale, this process will take a large team of researchers several years to complete. The finished product will be a seminal volume that will rewrite the history of the East St. Louis site and its contemporaries, helping us to better understand the people that made their lives in the fertile river valley that I now call home.So how did I end up with this awesome job, working on this awesome site? Well, unlike many of my colleagues, I didn’t always want to be an archaeologist. I used to go arrowhead hunting on the family farm as a child and was always fascinated with Native American culture, but I actually went to the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign to pursue a degree in music. I was derailed from that path by an excellent gen ed course in anthropology during my first semester, which led to a new major and my participation in Dr. Tim Pauketat’s archaeology field school the following summer. Several additional summers of excavation convinced me that there was no better life than the digging life, and I’ve been doing it ever since – for the government, independent contractors, universities, in graduate school at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and ultimately at ISAS on one of the most impressive and important projects in North America.The Archaeology Under the Arch by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"281","It’s two months since I started as Archaeology Officer for Leicestershire County Council and I’m finally starting to find my feet.  It’s the job I’ve always dreamed of and I feel very lucky to be doing something I love but have to admit to feeling overwhelmed with how much I have to learn!I was previously working exclusively with the a collection of Late Iron Age and Roman material known as the Hallaton Treasure and was based at Harborough Museum in the beautiful town of Market Harborough, Leicestershire.  This was an amazing job promoting and interpreting a mysterious collection of objects including over 5000 Iron Age and Roman coins and a Roman cavalry helmet.  However, as it was an externally funded project I knew it wouldn’t last forever and so when the opportunity came up to apply for a new post, I jumped at it.I am now responsible for the county’s archaeology collections, so although I still get to play with the Treasure, there is a huge amount of material I need to get to know a whole lot better which is fun and daunting at the same time.  My role also includes community archaeology - promoting best practice, providing support and linking community groups with the collections which we hold.  Thankfully my previous role brought me into contact with many of these wonderful local groups and so there are many friendly faces who have been helping me out during these first two months.  I am also lucky to be working with our Finds Liaison Officer, Wendy Scott, who has been helping me settle into my new job.Today I’ve been doing run of the mill stuff: checking emails, liaising with archaeological contractors, preparing for a launch event for the Leicestershire and Rutland Festival of Archaeology (the biggest regional contribution to the Council for British Archaeology’s nationwide event thanks to a fantastic network of heritage groups and enthusiastic indivuduals), working on press releases, trying to make time to do a bit of sorting in the store.A small area of the archaeology section of our museum store.Something cropped up which I haven’t dealt with before and sent me into a temporary panic.  An archaeological contractor (we are a repository for archaeological archives created as a result of the planning process) had found a human cremation and needed to know some details for the exhumation notice – what would happen to the remains after they had been studied.  The result was that we would make a decision on the merits of retaining the remains in our collection after the whole site had been studied and we could assess their importance.  The ethics of the treatment of human remains from archaeological excavations is an interesting area and one which I need to learn more about, fast!My day also included a very geeky conservation with two colleagues regarding how to allocate accession numbers to the Hallaton Roman helmet which is actually at least four helmets from one deposit.  Many parts are still in the British Museum’s Department of Conservation and Scientific Research as they have been analysing and conserving the parts for us.  A very boring conversation but important nonetheless.My day ended with lugging a huge display case into my car, ready for a display at Burrough Hill Iron Age hillfort on Sunday.  This is a University of Leicester dig at the highest point in Leicestershire, an amazing spot.  I’m providing a display of material we hold in our collection from digs dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, including a massive Iron Age storage jar.  Nice to be able to take it back to where it came from for the day!Iron Age storage jar found at Burrough Hill hillfort from Leicestershire County Council’s archaeology collection. The Leicestershire’s 2 Month Old Archaeology Officer by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"282","Today many people know that archaeologist around the world usually don’t work in pits with a shovel in their hand every day. What many people yet don’t know is that there are days in the professional life of an archaeologist in which he holds not even a single find in his hands and in which he doesn’t think of finds and reconstructing past lifeways at all.I’ve graduated from the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz with a degree in Prehistory. Currently I’m working at the MONREPOS Archaeological Research Center and Museum for Human Behavioral Evolution. This amazing institute is the place where I spent my Day of Archaeology 2012 without a shovel or even a single find.In the morning I administrated MONREPOS’ social networking accounts (twitter, facebook, Google+) and informed myself about new posts of people the institute follows. I also tweeted about our own activities, organizing several excavations for the summer. One of these field projects is the Lower Danube Survey for Paleolithic Sites. Together with collaborating institutes we will be conducting excavations at a newly discovered Lower Paleolithic site in Romania called Dealul Guran. As we are still looking for participants to join this year’s campaign I designed an information flyer and aupdated the project’s website. Since I will be working in the field myself I had to book a flight from Frankfurt to Bucharest and back.Just like in other professions, archaeologists have their spleens too. This time my fellow graduate students and I agreed in the need of buying special trowels for the above mentioned fieldwork in Romania. So we gathered around a computer and purchased some equipment that deemed us to be indispensable for a successful summer. Being a post-graduate I frequently think about a topic to focus on next. On the Day of Archaeology I therefore met with one of my supervisors in our institute’s lounge to chat about possible projects.Last but not least, let me clarify my point: I do dig pits at times.The No Shovel at All – A Day in Pictures by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"283","“Awe” would be the word that sums up my experiences on the Day of Archaeology. I spent the weekend working in a cave documenting prehistoric rock art; a project that completely ripped me out of my archaeological comfort zone putting me back into the position of archaeological newbie with a lot to learn.I spent the project under the care of Brandon Ritchison, an archaeologist who recently graduated with a Bachelor Degree from the University of Kentucky and is on the way to a graduate program in the fall. He was building on research he completed for his Undergrad Thesis and intends to present it at the Southeastern Archaeology Conference this year (so you can get all the details about the research project there, I will not share them in this post for a variety of reasons). I owed Brandon some labor in return for his help on my dissertation field work earlier in the year and I had been in caves numerous times during middle and high school field trips to Mammoth Cave National Park. What I didn’t realize was that this was  a “wild cave”… about as far away from Mammoth Cave’s manicured paths, modern lighting, and massive open spaces as you could get.Packing for this excursion was much different than other projects. We weren’t excavating, just taking photos, drawing, and marking things on a map. My field pack consisted of lots of food and water (it was 106 degrees outside) and light sources (I think I had 7 lights of various sizes), LOTS of replacement batteries, and a long sleeve shirt. Brandon provided a helmet with lantern.Me geared up and ready to go. I wore a long sleeve shirt in the cave.The road the lead to the cave was blocked by fallen trees and we had to hike about an hour and a half through the hundred degree weather to the cave entrance. Arriving at the entrance is where I realized that this weekend would be spent outside of my comfort zone.Instead of a wide cavernous opening (see the Mammoth Cave Website link above for an image of the opening I was expecting) there was a solid rock wall with an opening about .75 meter high at the base of it. I hadn’t asked Brandon about the dimensions of the cave because, honestly, up until that point I hadn’t thought of it. I wasn’t sure if I was afraid of small spaces because, honestly, up until that point I never had to crawl into something so small.A few things got me through that initial trepidation:A map showing that the cave opened up after about 14 feet (5 meters) of crawlingcuriosity about my own psychological limitationsthere was a really cool breeze coming out of the cave… 60 something degrees is a lot better than 106 degreesknowing that I had already Tweeted about doing this for Day of Archaeology and wanting to post something more fun than stopping at the entrance of a cool cave and turning around.So with an advanced apology of possibly freaking out, I followed the rest of the team crawling into the ground and then it was instantly dark. I mean REALLY dark, to the point where I really couldn’t tell if my eyes were open or shut. Flicking on the lights illuminated a ceiling covered with cave crickets, there was a salamander, and a few bats.Cave Crickets covered the ceiling in most areas The map showed that the cave was about 700 ft (200 meters) deep and had multiple passages. The first section that we were standing in was large enough to put a four lane highway in, the ceiling varied from a few stories high to a few feet.The cave was wet and about half of the walls had been covered in flow stone which had been destroyed by early Kentuckians who mined it and carved the crystalline rock into knick-knacks. The floor was covered with sharp stones from this mining and there were a few traces left of their activity. There was a variety of cave art. Much of it was historic graffiti consisting of names and dates of different visitors to the cave. These were either etched into the walls and ceiling or “candle marked” with the soot from torches, candles, or lanterns.In certain areas there were prehistoric petroglyphs (art that is incised into the rock). Surprisingly, the only way that most of this art was really visible is when your headlight is off and the wall is indirectly illuminated at an oblique angle. This made collections of zigzag lines and concentric squares stand out in relief. Sometimes it was so faint, I wondered if most of the cave’s visitors even realized that it was there.The corner of some concentric squares only visible when the light is at an angle.Lighting made the art very difficult to photograph and draw, but I opted to spend the day drawing a concentration of art several meters long that covered the ceiling. The other option was to belay across a very deep pit and squeeze through a rock tube that was about the diameter of my shoulder width for about 10 meters before reaching the final cavern.This was the easy partBeing my first time in a wild cave I decided not to push my luck and I would tackle that challenge when I return on a future expedition. After spending about 8 hours in the cave we crawled back out of the cave.Water on the cave ceiling where I spent most of the dayWhile the project was fun, the archaeology was interesting, and I was already making a list of caving gear I wanted to buy, but I had never been so glad to see the hot summer sun.Light at the cave entrance as we were leaving.The Drawing Cave Art in Kentucky by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"286","I am a part-time postgraduate student, currently working towards an MSc in Archaeological Research at the University of Nottingham, which will take two years to complete. I’ve come back to archaeology after a long break, during which time I have pursued my career in research and academic computing. However, I am still in love with archaeology so my long-held ambition to do a further degree in the subject is at last being realised and I am really enjoying it, despite all the late nights reading and working on essays after I’ve finished my day job. As a mature student, I was concerned at first that I would find it difficult to fit in. However, the staff and my fellow students have been really encouraging, which is helping to make the whole experience very satisfying.The taught part of our course has finished for this year, so it’s now time to get down to preparing for the research work which will form the basis of the 15,000 word dissertation we must submit and which accounts for a third of the credits on our course. I’m interested in the application of scientific techniques in archaeology, which has influenced my choices of modules, including archaeobotany and zooarchaeology, and my research will be using a fascinating technique, stable isotope analysis, to try to answer some interesting archaeological questions. I am lucky that a new project based in our department has recently started — Dama International: Fallow Deer and European Society, 6000BC to AD1500 — so my research work is part of that project, analysing samples from fallow deer antlers which have been found on Iron Age and Roman sites in Britain, to see whether the results can suggest the diet consumed by the deer while the antlers were developing and possibly to infer whether they were local in Britain during that time. This has interesting implications for trade, especially during the Iron Age, when fallow deer were not living natively in this country and the antlers could have been imported as a commodity, as well as for the reintroduction of the species during the Roman period, when one or more small breeding populations are thought to have been established, for example, at the prestigious Roman villa at Fishbourne in Sussex. The results from archaeological specimens will be set against samples taken from modern fallow antlers from a known location, as a control. I’ll be doing the analysis at the NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, at the British Geological Survey in Keyworth. NIGL has an established and illustrious track record of work in archaeological isotope work and luckily, it’s not far from where I live.However, I first have to track down some of the known archaeological specimens, which is how I spent my Day of Archaeology. It’s proving to be an interesting challenge, as some of the excavations which have reported finds of fallow antler took place 50 or more years ago, so I have to hope that once I locate where the finds are archived, they still have the antler and that it has been correctly identified! By following connections from the literature and making enquiries by e-mail, I’m currently on the trail of some pieces excavated from an Iron Age site near Cambridge in the 1960’s and an antler found in the well of a Roman villa in Norfolk.I must pay tribute to the helpful people I’ve contacted who are responsible for archives of material such as this, who take their time to look through their collections for obscure finds at the request of university researchers like me. Some enquiries have drawn a blank, either because of mis-identification or, while fallow bones were found, as at the Roman fort at Binchester, County Durham, the antler itself turned out to be from red deer. However, that’s all part of the research process, which is fascinating.Assuming I can get some archaeological samples to analyse, I hope to report back next year on what the results tell us! The On the Trail of the Elusive Fallow Deer… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"287","Hi. My name is Christina O’Regan and I am the Fieldwork and Educational Director of Irish Archaeological Research (IAR). Three colleagues and I set up this non-profit social organisation in early 2011 with the aim of getting the public more involved with archaeology through education, workshops, and community events. We are all from commercial archaeological backgrounds and wanted to develop our experience in community archaeology.					#gallery-1 {				margin: auto;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-item {				float: left;				margin-top: 10px;				text-align: center;				width: 33%;			}			#gallery-1 img {				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {				margin-left: 0;			}																	Students learn the importance of paperwork by deconstructing a fake poo.																			Front cover of the Spring edition of our e-zine.				A focus has been the delivery of school workshops, typically to second level students in years 8 – 12. These workshops begin with a general introduction to the archaeology of Ireland, followed by a practical session varying from how to make and decorate prehistoric-style pottery, learning about diet through artificial ‘poo’ dissection, hands-on interaction with genuine and replica artefacts and prehistoric hunting techniques. These workshops have been incredibly successful, with benefits for students and teachers alike.My work in IAR varies from day-to-day as I develop workshops, plan for future events and shoot off a few emails to raise the profile of IAR within the archaeological and educational sectors.For this year’s Festival of British Archaeology, we have decided to host two family-orientated events; the first at Glenariff Forest Park (July 21st & 22nd) and the second at Gosford Forest Park (July 28th & 29th). Our experience with the school workshops has shown us that the more practical the day, the better. Pottery workshops, archery, demonstrations of flint knapping and a children’s activity area will ensure there is something for everyone to enjoy. There will also be a mini museum, with an interactive artefacts table as well as information on the archaeology of the areas where the events will be held (Antrim and Armagh). The Northern Ireland Environment Agency have very generously granted us a loan of some artefacts from both counties and I joyously spent an afternoon sifting through their stores, picking out choice artefacts with the help of Andrew Gault from the Agency. We are also busy planning similar events for National Heritage Week in the Republic of Ireland, August 18th – 26th.A trial run of the Open Air Museum at the Carnival of Colours, Londonderry showed us the enormous benefits this type of venture can have in increasing awareness of local heritage within communities.Social media has been a lifeline for IAR with our Facebook page now ‘liked’ by over 1,000 people. The page allows us to announce all of our upcoming events as well as share archaeological discoveries and support other institutions and companies. Facebook also allows us to easily disseminate our free online magazine, Irish Archaeological Research and we have just put out a call for articles for the fourth (summer) edition. As editor of the e-zine, I envisage many late nights over the coming weeks organising layout and thinking up witty headlines!For more information on any of our events see www.irisharchaeologicalresearch.com The Education, Community and Irish Archaeological Research by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

In these months we are studying the finds (pottery, metal and bones) and organizing the archaeological record for final publication and WebGIS.Thanks to archaeological research in the municipality of Montescudaio (PI), which started back in 2004, today we achieved a complete map of the main evidences and the most important monuments of cultural interest.Among  these, since the beginning of the survey emerged the so called “Badia” (abbey), the Benedectine convent dedicated to Saint Mary born at the end of the XI century. Its significance is due both to the importance of the site through the centuries and to the strong connections between the monastery and the town community.And it’s exactly in the area known as “Badia” that, since the summer 2005, with the cooperation between the municipal administation and the University of Pisa, the archaeological research is recovering the remains of this beautiful church ad the surrounding cloister.Yuri AleseMonica BaldassarriGiuseppe Clemente Marcella GiorgioFrancesca LemmCristina OteraSilvia Rezza Claudia Sciuto(Italian National Association of Archaeologists) Bibliography:Andreazzoli F., Baldassarri M. 2006, Il monastero di S.

We processed soil samples from our excavations at Bartlemas Chapel in east Oxford, most of which were from grave fills.Volunteers sorted their residues by size using microscopes and hand lenses. They collected artefacts and recorded their proportions on recording forms as well as what material was discarded for each fraction (sample size). The artefacts were bagged together with their forms ready for the next stage of analysis.Our volunteers said they really enjoyed the session and found it really interesting to see the material that can be collected through this process (including some charred seed’s, teeth, bone fragments and tiny mammal bones). They also said that participating in post excavation helped them to understand why soil samples are taken and why careful labelling and accurate recording is so important on site! They said that being involved in these post excavation processes helped feed back into the way they worked on site.The Archeox project is extremely proud to announce it has been shortlisted for Best Community Archaeology Project at the British Archaeology Awards 2012!You can follow the work of our volunteers at our website: www.archeox.net, on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ArchaeologyOfEastOxford and on Twitter too: http://twitter.com/#!/archeoxnetThe Community ‘Environmental’ Archaeologists! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"290","June 29th found me, as it usually does, doing archaeology.  Some years I’m excavating, some years I am lecturing to groups who are visiting sites like the ones I’ve excavated, and some years, like this one, I am working away on the publication of finds from all those years of excavating.Glass is a beautiful, seductive material and a rich source of evidence about technical and aesthetic aspects of a culture and about the complex processes of exchange and influence between cultures.  Glass — luxurious, expensive, and resource intensive — reflects the decision-making of the elites and their sense of style. The production of glass is a fundamental technology based on complex technical knowledge and specialized skill. Glass, discovered by accident, grew to transform the environment of daily life by brightening tables and structures. The story of the coming of age of glass is one of the fascinating stories in the history of technology. One you should check into.I am currently working on the glass from three sites:  Aila and Humaya in Jordan, and Gordion in Turkey.  The glass recovered from these three sites covers the gamut of glass forming technologies (molded, core-formed, mosaic, blown) and ancient periods of production (Iron Age through early Islamic).  So working on archaeological glass asks for a dedication to the material itself in all its life phases and permutations.  Ever since I worked at the Jamestown Glasshouse during my undergraduate years, it’s been glass for me just as it’s coins or bones or pottery for someone else.Today, on the Day of Archaeology, it’s Roman glass from Gordion, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia.  I am beginning to write up the chapter on Roman glass for a final report.Gordion had an interesting Roman period, one until recently mostly overlooked, and has produced interesting Roman glass that reveals periods of economic prosperity, a taste for luxury glass tablewares, and information about Gordion’s connections to the outer world in the period.For today, a closer look at a heavily weathered fragmentary mosaic bowl.Heavily weathered fragments of mosaic bowl in new container.As with the study of other artifact, the study of this glass has several stages.  Because we are not permitted to remove the glass from Turkey, I have carefully examined, measured, described, and drawn each artifact in the depots at the excavation house near Gordion.  Here in my lab at Bucknell University this summer I am working from my drawings, notes, and from photographs I have taken in Turkey (some of which are below).This fragmentary bowl was excavated in 1951 and had received relatively little (no?) attention over the years.  Several years ago we moved the fragments from a candy box with tissue paper padding into a beautifully designed container created by Ariel O’Connor, a Gordion conservation intern.  It has been a puzzling vessel for me because of the heavy weathering, but seemed clearly to be a mosaic bowl of some sort. I have worked with conservators on site to remove some of the weathering layers to see what lay below.  What you see in the following photos is what we found.Cleaned fragment.Cleaned fragment with color scheme of mosaic strips visible (back lit).Great excitement as we uncover gold!Cleaned fragment with gold band visible in sunlight.Fragment with gold band (back lit).Quite a difference from those gray, filmy pieces in the first picture!Here’s a photo of  part of the rim of the bowl:Cleaned fragment of rim (back lit). Today, in my library full of studies of excavated glass and museum collections, I have been trying to figure out the technique, color scheme, and date of the vessel.  I am also trying to locate comparable excavated pieces or pieces in collections that will give me hints to the origin and date.A final entry on this piece in my field notebook says the fragments appear to show that the vessel was fashioned from tooled strips of canes with a repeating sequence of turquoise blue, yellow edged in purple, opaque white edged in dark blue, and colorless encasing shattered gold leaf.A wonderful aspect of my job is spending a pleasant hour or so leafing through likely museum catalogues and that thrill of discovery when I find, just now, what I was looking for – a parallel in profile, technique, and color scheme, in a favorite publication – David Grose’s catalogue of early ancient glass in the Toledo Museum of Art (1989).And the answer is:  The vessel is very likely a gold-band mosaic bowl of the early to mid-first century BCE.  The profile is that of a broad shallow bowl with an upright rim with a narrow rounded edge. It was likely assembled in sections from tooled, fused strips, molded, then rotary polished.  It is one of two bowls (some of the fragments are definitely from a second bowl).New problem(!):  The bowl appears to come from a securely dated context – a destruction level – that’s a century earlier than that.  Hmm.  Well, this is how we make progress.   Stay tuned for the final publication!The Digging Glass: A Day in the Glass Lab by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"291","June 29, 2012 – Welcome to my day.My Name is Marcel Dallinger. I got my Magister degree in classical archaeology at Leipzig University in November 2011.Currently I am working on an excavation in the castle of Rochlitz executed by the State Office for Archaeology Saxony. Rochlitz itself is a medium-sized town in Saxony/ Germany.My day starts at 6 a.m. in Sörnzig. After getting up and doing all the things that have to be done in the morning my way leads me to Rochlitz Castle which is approximately 3km away. Fortunately I own a little motorbike so the ride is rather a little trip through fields than a typical commute.Work starts at 7am. The excavation team meets in our lunchroom. It is luckily the same room where all our equipment is stored therefore we have short distances to everything we need.The excavation we are working on is a ‘rescue excavation’. The castle yard is about to be renewed completely. This includes new pipes for waste water, fresh water, rain water, earth-wires and all power supply lines. Finally the whole castle yard will get a new cobbled paving.Thus our task is to excavate all parts of the castle yard which had not been excavated before- and this is approximately 70%. Most of them dates from the late Middle Ages.The salvage of findings, their documentation and to save them from the dredger is exactly what we are doing there. But I have to say that all the other workers and especially the operator of the dredgers are very friendly and take care of us and the work we are doing. The normal dig goes on with well-known trowels. For measuring we use a tachymeter connected to AutoCad. Because of our lack of time we also do photogrammetrie. Sometimes it is better to draw archaeological records but this needs time that we don’t have. We have our morning break around 9am. After recharging our batteries we keep on revealing the secrets of history from the ground. Of course not every day we make great findings but thanks to the still opened castle museum there is a lot of public business. One day we were surprised by a visit of a television crew. But they were doing a documentary about the new exhibition in the museum so we could watch them filming and interviewing while continuing our work.The last period of our day is from lunch break at 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. . At the end of our day we give ourselves a pat on the back for another great and interesting day working in the job with the most public Interest: archaeology.					#gallery-1 {				margin: auto;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-item {				float: left;				margin-top: 10px;				text-align: center;				width: 33%;			}			#gallery-1 img {				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {				margin-left: 0;			}																																																																	The Rescue Excavation at Rochlitz Castle by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

New website has to have a more user-friendly authoring interface and we need to understand our audience, their language how they’re likely to navigate our site. We then need to have that information architecture translated in to a web site design then get the thing built and tested. We have some short deadlines and I am suspicious of external consultants not being as frank as we need them to be about what we absolutely must do as opposed to what we could do. Am reminded of Paul Theroux who wrote in the Mosquito Coast about Amazonian Indians seeing a block of ice for the first time produced by a massive homemade fridge built by Harrison Ford, that ‘ any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,’ and worry that some consultants assume that the same is true of arcane knowledge, and hope that punters will pay for their advice because they don’t understand it.

This is interpolated from archaeological and geological borehole data and the thousands of deposit survival forms, which are filled out at the end of excavations, recording the height at which geological layers were encountered. First results encouraging, notwithstanding concerns over identification of truncation (which would show geological deposits as being un-naturally deep) and I have a satisfactory wedge of cheese, which very roughly represents the layer of archaeological deposits overlying the two hills of the City.  Enthused and with the idea of Eskimos cutting out ice blocks from the surface of a lake in my head, I experiment with extruding building footprints downwards to represent the pieces of cheese (or ice) which have gone,  due to cutting of basements.  Having pleaded for a sample city building height data from a friendly supplier,  am able to extrude a small area of the city upwards, and render things so you can see the bit above and the bit below ground.  It’s all pretty vague of course, but it may do as a proof of concept for EH and archaeological advisors to have them contemplate the benefit of a decent basement data collection project.  Fingers crossed.Layer of archaeological deposits overlying the two hills of the City13:30-14:00  Helped Rafel  bring 16 new PCs and monitors up from the goods yard.

Phew, we wrote a blog about it too you can see it here http://locatinglondonspast.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/populating-rocque-what-was-where/This picture is an example of how good a fit we were able to get between adjoining sheets of the 1746 Rocque map through cunning manipulation of the sheet scans to allow for the differential shrinkage and warping that map sheet experienced since they were made.Fleet prison with a lovely horizontal seam going straight through itAnd now… the seam is goneThe movie (linked below) shows a traverse of the street network of London c.1746 used during processing to check that the graph was truly connected, but it also has geo-social research applications interested in proximity, distribution and so forth.Traverse of the street network of London c.174616:00 Fill out a change control form to inform IT and the outsourced helpdesk of a server re-boot I want to do tomorrow.  We have a problem with old GIS files that access data on an older server (which we want to decommission) hanging when that server is switched off, rather than failing gracefully by opening but without the unreachable layers. Purpose of shutdown is so I can log the TCP connections the old GIS file tries to make as it starts up.  This should help diagnose the problem.16:15 Query Jamie on uncertainties regarding the modification wanted to the dendrochronological recording form on our central database. This one was around date ranges.  Do we need and if so which fields ought we to be using to record the date range of the tree? – i.e. acorn to death, the date range of the archaeological feature of which the timber is part, or the lifespan of the tree.  How to best record an estimate or actual lifespan if the entire record of rings is not present which it often isn’t.  Sometimes we can also identify timbers from the same tree (as possible amongst the massive Roman and Medieval oak waterfront  timbers recently excavated on a large site on the Thames foreshore), but how best to record? Appears to be a one to many situation but to avoid a horrible Cartesian product,  the likely SOP is that timbers from the same tree are mapped to that with the lowest context number; on the logic that the lowest one is more likely be the first discovered.Timber structure on recent Thames foreshore site16:45 Prepare screen shots for staff meeting, and recruit Steph and Nigel to enthuse about on-going vitality of our Facebook and Twitter streams. Much interest indicated following our discussion of the Shakespearian Curtain Theatre in Hackney. This was a major find and such a well-timed one. Named after the nearby Curtain Close, it was the main venue for Shakespeare’s plays between 1597 and 1599 until the Globe was completed in Southwark. Popular recent posts include other small wonders such as the discovery of a bricked-up collection of head-gear and other apparel during our work at the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich.Curtain Theatre foundations (those knobbly things which make up a yard area are Sheep knuckle bones)17:00 We say good bye to an old colleague who is retiring after 30 years work with MOLA.  Andrew was an old mentor of mine when I first arrived as a green student, in the then Department of Urban Archaeology (DUA) 22 years ago. Having been used to excavations on the wide open spaces of Salisbury plain, I probably drove him mad with all my questions about how the DUA dig this complex urban stratigraphy, and how they understand what it is they have dug.  Getting my head around all the procedures that had been devised to allow accurate but also time-effective recording.  He was all over it and remained so.  A great archaeologist and friend, I will miss him.  Carol, our bubbly receptionist, does him proud with a wonderful homemade cake which she produces for all leavers – the woman is a diamond.17:30  Intense discussion with training supplier on subject of Application Express, a data entry environment  for Oracle databases that’s totally web-based and would be a valuable tool in our tactic to move more data entry into the field to reduce double-handling of information. The big idea is to re-appraise the paper recording sheets used on site for various types of context (a valuable exercise on its own) and then from that look at what could be usefully recorded digitally.  Don’t want to record stuff digitally simply because we can, there has to be a purpose and a benefit.  That benefit should be in greater efficiency, but equally I want to ease some of the more mundane aspect of recording.  For example change a prompt requiring a discursive response, which analytically does not have great value, into a tick-box.  Want to do this as we need to get our archaeologists, especially the younger ones coming into the profession more engaged with the process of thinking what it all means.  We don’t want people just filling out checklists, we want them engaged, and enfranchised, and if we can give them more time to do that by streamlining the data collection then that will really help.17:40-18.30  Have third and final cup of tea, update helpdesk call list with work done, restart the computer, turn off the screens and pedal for home.The Pete Rauxloh: A Busy Day in Archaeological IT by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"293","Over  the last year my team have went through a massive restructure (fairly typical local government practice these days), and I was lucky enough to keep my job after being re interviewed. Last year I was HERO (Historic Environment Records Officer) and now I am an Historic Environment Consultant – which doesn’t quite have the same ring to it! I’m now working in a multi-disciplinary team called Place Services, which comprises archaeologists, historic buildings advisors, ecologists, urban designers, landscape architects and strategic environmental planners. We provide a holistic way of managing and protecting all elements of the natural, historic and build environment. Consequently, there have been lots of changes to the type of work I do, and I’m enjoying working on big, multi-disciplinary projects. In the last month I have complete a Conservation Area Appraisal, conducted a visitor participation survey at a castle and wrote part of a  funding application for an exciting community engagement project. Last week was incredibly busy and chaotic, so this week is about catching up on my ‘real’ work. On Monday morning my first task was to deal with some emails, mainly invoices that needed sent out and a few HER enquiries from students. There are always a few final year students who start their dissertation early and need information. I then moved onto checking the weekly planning list for Epping Forest, as I now do the development control archaeology for the district as part of my new role. I checked the weeks planning applications, highlighting any that may have  below ground impact, involve historic buildings or historic areas. By locating the sites on the GIS mapping and referring to the HER,I can check which planning proposals are likely to have an archaeological impact and make recommendations to mitigate damage and record the archaeology. I signed off some documentation so that an excavation can begin in the coming weeks, and wrote a brief for an archaeological contractor for a historic barn recording. Over the rest of the week I will be giving the HER my full attention, we recently scanned our entire gray literature library and I need to transfer the reports onto the network so they can be linked to our database. Next week I will probably have another project design to contribute to, and possibly get a sneak peak at a certain olympics venue before the games start!The Local Government Archaeology 2012 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"294","I’m Charlotte Douglas, public archaeologist for AOC Archaeology Group. I live in Edinburgh and am usually based in our northern office, but I spent Friday 29th and Saturday 30th June in London, helping our southern team in the delivery of a community project in Eastcote.Eastcote House Gardens were once home to Eastcote House. Records suggest that there was a building on the site from as early as the 16th century. Eastcote House itself was demolished in the 1960s after falling into disrepair. The remaining park is maintained by the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens, and they, along with London Borough of Hillingdon (LBH) council, were recently awarded funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help them progress their plans for the gardens. They aim to apply for further HLF funding in the future so that they can improve the gardens’ facilities, repair and improve the historic buildings, and excavate the site of Eastcote House. This preliminary phase of the project involved excavating four 2m x 10m trial trenches on the site of the house to confirm its location and assess the condition of the remains, as well as testing the community involvement and outreach. Paul Mason, one of AOC’s project managers, has been working closely with the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens and London Borough of Hillingdon council to ensure that the project turns out exactly as they want it. My role as public archaeologist varies from project to project but my main role at Eastcote was to deliver a programme of activities for local children when they visited the site.A team of around 40 volunteers, mostly members of the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens, took part in the excavations which were directed by Les Capon and supervised by Chris Clarke of AOC. Saturday was the official Open Day, with the Friends offering tea and biscuits and bounteous local knowledge, and with AOC’s Fitz manning a finds-handling table under a gazebo clearly not designed to withstand a bit of a breeze! Many people visited the gardens to check out the excavations over the two days, and the end-of-day tour on Saturday saw about 60 people of all ages peering into the trenches and finding out about the weekend’s findings.AOC’s Chris leads the end-of-day tour on SaturdayAround 65 local children participated in the excavations: Year 5 and 6 pupils fromWarrenderSchool, Ruislip, came to the gardens on Friday morning and Cubs and Beavers from the local Scout Group visited on Saturday afternoon. The children explored the gardens with Lesley from the Friends, learning about the gardens’ history and visiting the dovecote and the herb garden. Funnily enough, the part of the garden tour that seems to have stuck in their minds the most is the fact that the poo in the bottom of the dovecote would have been collected and used in the production of gunpowder! Their second favourite fact was that strong herbs were sometimes used in sauces in the past to disguise the pungent smell of off fish… Delicious!The children also participated in an archaeology workshop, learning about archaeologists and excavation, and played a timelines game. My job is to make archaeology fun – to engage with the children in a meaningful way, so that what they learn sticks in the mind. And of course, it’s essential that they enjoy themselves! I encourage the children to ask lots of questions and to steer the conversation – if they’d rather talk about bog bodies than pottery morphologies, so be it! Activities tend to be interactive and informal, allowing the children to move around and make a bit of noise. The timelines game also involves doing a bit of maths. I was really impressed by how much the children knew about some of the historical figures and archaeological sites featured in the timelines game.After completing the workshop and game, I took the children onto the site itself. Here they donned high vis vests (essential for any archaeologist) and gloves, and armed with trowels and sieves they carefully looked through the loose soil generated by the excavations, retrieving mostly metal, pottery and glass related to the house demolished in the 1960s. The children seemed to have a great time, and I always really enjoy having them onsite – not least because they often ask questions that make you scratch your head and think about archaeology differently! I often have a sore throat at the end of a day involving lots of school children from talking as loudly and enthusiastically as I can, but its great fun nonetheless.In terms of the archaeological findings, the massively thick foundations (up to 4ft) of the house were revealed in each of the three trenches and the walls of the coach house in the fourth; two trenches also revealed the remains of a basement/cellar level. The discovery of a series of steps that led down to a vaulted cellar in Trench 3 promoted an easily imaginable flow of people around the building. Most of the brickwork appeared to be 18th century in date, but pieces of 16th century brick indicate that the remains of the medieval house are not too distant from our reach. The most significant finds recovered were fragments of pottery that date from the 14th to 20th centuries. These finds show the site to have been inhabited for over 700 years.Trench 2: the major northern wallThe volume of attendance and participation in Friday and Saturday’s activities demonstrate the high level of local passion and support for the gardens and their past, and will surely bolster the Friends’ and LBH’s case in any further application for funding.One of AOC’s archaeologists will present the results of the excavations at a public lecture sometime soon (date and venue TBC). For more information and event updates please see www.hillingdon.gov.ukFor more information on the gardens please see www.eastcoteparkestate.org.uk  The Community Excavations at Eastcote House Gardens, Hillingdon by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"295","Lea and Birgitte use trowel and total station to document Copenhagen’s former western gateway.Its another typical day for the crew at Rådhuspladsen (Town Hall Square) in Copenhagen, where the Museum of Copenhagen (www.copenhagen.dk) has been conducting a major excavation since January 2011. Soon to be completed, the excavation – conducted in advance of the construction of a new Metro station – has seen remains of perhaps the earliest urban activity in this area, from the 1100s, as well as fragments of the city’s medieval and post-medieval western gates, city moat, bridge remains and a host of later archaeological structures including a seventeenth century mill building and even some World War 2 bomb shelters. Amazing organic preservation is one of the key features of the site, with textiles, leather shoes, book covers and a host of other everyday items from the late medieval and post-medieval periods surviving in excellent condition, particularly in the waterlogged moat deposits.With barrow and shovel.This site is one of four major excavations being carried out by the Museum of Copenhagen as part of the advance works of the new Metro City-Ring Project. The others included Kongens Nytorv (The Kings New Square) where the city’s eastern defences and former gate structures were revealed, Assistens Kirkegard cemetery excavation, and the ongoing excavation at Gammel Strand (Old Beach) where part of the citys old harbour area is being uncovered.The crew enjoying a well earned morning coffee at 9 – work starts at 7 a.m.With a crew of c.40, this is one of the largest archaeological excavation projects carried out in Denmark to date, and has seen the Museum of Copenhagen expand its archaeology section greatly, with the assembly of an international crew including English, Swedish, Norwegians, Polish and Irish members to compliment the Danish core. By the time all of the excavations have been completed in 2013, a wealth of new knowledge about the birth and growth of Copenhagen will have been gained. In the meantime, information about the ongoing excavations are being shared with the public on a regular basis on the museum’s interactive website http://vaeggen.copenhagen.dk/media/76182.The Rådhuspladsen, Copenhagen by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"296","Welcome to another post to the Archaeology Data Service (ADS)  Day of Archaeology blog 2012If you want a quick introduction to the ADS and what we do see last year’s post.We have contributions from two members of staff from the ADS this year, one from Stuart Jeffrey ADS deputy Director (Access) and this one from Ray Moore one of the ADS Digital Archivists.As a digital archivist at the Archaeology Data Service, my day to day activities involve the accessioning the digital data and other outcomes of archaeological research that individuals and institutions deposit with us, developing a preservation programme for that data, but also curating existing ADS collections.Today, and indeed for the past week, I have spent much of my time working on the Grey Literature Library (or GLL).  The GLL is an important resource for those amateur and professional archaeologists working in archaeology today providing access to the many thousands of unpublished fieldwork reports, or grey literature, produced during the various assessments, surveys and fieldwork carried out throughout the country. These activities are recorded using OASIS (or Online AccesS to the Index of archaeological investigationS) and after passing through a process of validation and checking the reports produced in these projects arrive at the ADS. On first impressions then the digital archive may seem like an ‘end point’, a place where archaeological grey literature goes to die, but the ADS, through the GLL, makes these reports available to other archaeologists and the wider community allowing the grey literature to inform future research. At the same time as a digital archive we take steps to preserve these reports so that future generations can continue to use the information that they contain; an important job as many of these reports do not exist in a printed form.Reports from the Grey Literature Library.So what does digitally archiving a grey literature report entail? Initially all the grey literature reports must be transferred from OASIS to the ADS archive; the easiest part of the process. More often than not the report comes in a Portable Document Format (or PDF) form, and while this is useful for sharing documents electronically it is pretty useless as preservation format for archiving. One of my jobs is to convert these files into a special archival form of PDF, called PDF/A (the A standing for Archive). Sound’s easy, but often it can take some work to get from PDF to PDF/A (my all time record is 2 hours producing a 900mb PDF/A file). These conversions must also be documented in the ADS’ Collection Management System so that other archivists can see what I did to the file to preserve the file and its content. While OASIS collects metadata associated with project, the ADS uses a series of tools to generate file level metadata specific to the creation of the file, so that we can understand what and how the file was created. Only once these processes are complete can the file be transferred to the archive, with a version also added to the GLL so that people can download and read the report. With a through flow of some 5 to 600 reports per month the difficulties of the task should become apparent; and all this alongside my other duties as a digital archivist. This month’s release includes an interesting report on The Olympic Park Waterways and Associated Built Heritage Structures which stood on the site now occupied by the Olympic Park. Anyway I’d better get back to it!The The Archaeology Data Service, keeping the Grey Literature Library going by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"297","A quite belated Day of Archaeology post since I’m in the field at the moment and am quite restricted for time, which is basically what this post will be about.I’m an honours student in archaeology at the University of Queensland and for the past month I have been volunteering on archaeological excavations across Arnhem Land in the north of Australia. When I’m not being a student and volunteering on digs I’m also the Membership Secretary for the Australian Archaeological Association (AAA).Currently I’m working with a fabulous multi-disciplinary team on the re-excavation of Malakunanja II, which is in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, Australia. This is a key site in Australian archaeology due to its early age and potential to improve what we currently know about the early occupation of Australia. Due to agreements made with the Traditional Owners of this area I cannot post details on what we’re doing at the site, so it is quite fortuitous for me that the 29th falls on a day off for us and the first one I’ve had since arriving in the Northern Territory.On this Day of Archaeology I am busy catching up on my work for the AAA, which is run exclusively by a small number of volunteers who keep the Association running and continually improving. Even though I have internet access of an evening finding the time to attend my AAA responsibilities (as well as my own research!) after a full day of excavation (7am-6pm in the field) is near impossible. So this precious day off is being filled with yet more work.As the Membership Secretary for AAA my main responsibility is to manage our membership base, e.g. making sure memberships are processed correctly, updating member details, providing access to the member only pages of the website.  I’ve spent most of the 29th working on AAA’s new website and sending out individual login details to our members. This has essentially meant sitting at my computer all day and sending practically the same email to AAA’s 800+ current members.My main reason for devoting my day off to such a tedious job is not just out of a sense of responsibility, but also out of genuine affection for the Association and the work that it does in the Australian archaeological community. Whilst the responsibility of being an executive member of AAA can be overwhelming and time consuming, it is extremely rewarding and has provided me with an incredible number of unique opportunities. So I should probably consider myself lucky to have it taking up my first day off in a month.Ultimately time is precious to archaeologists in more ways than one. I think this is a valuable lesson to learn as a student, and balancing competing responsibilities and demands on my time is something that I will likely spend the rest of my career working on.We’re returning to excavation tomorrow with the privilege of starting work at 7am! You’ll be able to follow some of our progress by following me on twitter, @archaeo_jacq.Jacq Some of the beautiful scenery I’ve been lucky enough to experience whilst doing fieldwork in Arnhem Land for the past month.The A Precious Day Off in Kakadu National Park by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"298"," Many greetings from the Smithsonian!With Syria and its UNESCO world heritage sites in the news these weeks, it is time to look at one of those sites described as one of the surviving wonders of antiquity: Palmyra. Also, we are in the preparation of an exciting exhibition with a wide array of objects from yet another fascinating part of the world, ancient Kazakhstan, that will open soon to the Sackler Gallery here in the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.We are  in the first week of July 2012. First thing Monday morning, was catching up on the latest news from Kazakhstan for our upcoming exhibition highlight Nomads and Networks: The Ancient Art and Culture of Kazakhstan. One of our colleagues, Claudia Chang, in Kazakhstan had reported earlier this week on this blog and we will continue to run a parallel blog on our exhibition and ancient Kazakhstan on our website starting soon before the exhibition opening in August here in Washington, DC.Also this Monday, before a meeting with our colleagues from the embassy of Kazakhstan, I presented some current research on pigments and paints on ancient near eastern stone monuments to a wider public in the Smithsonian Institution’s Smithsonian Congress of Scholars Research Tent on the Mall. Despite some heat waves, a good number of visitors came to some twenty presentations from units in the institution, and asked also many questions about the role of pigments on stone monuments in the Ancient Near East. By studying materials that still contain much of the pigments, we can learn more about the aesthetics of the ancient world. Palmyra, “the Place of Palms” as it was known to the Romans, in modern Syria, flourished as a colourful caravan oasis on the trade route linking the Mediterranean with West and Central Asia. Most of the monuments visible on the site today date from the first three centuries CE, including the large colonnade streets and the extensive cemeteries around the city.In 1908, while on a trip to Aleppo, the rich Detroit business-men Charles Lang Freer (1854-1919), see himself above, acquired a lime stone relief from the site from the dealer Joseph Marcopoli (F1908.236). Originally, reliefs like this one would have marked the tombs of wealthy Palmyrene citizens, either in tower-tombs or complex hypogea below ground. According to an Aramaic inscription, it is the portrait of Haliphat, daughter of Oglata, son of Harimai. This stele is dated 543 of the Seleucid era, which corresponds to the year 231 in the Christian calendar. The stone relief is one of many from Palmyra still preserving traces of the original polychromy. Some of these can be even seen with the naked eye, like the jewellery on the left hand or in details of her necklace.Microscope images would make painted details much more visible and a red colorant on the statue has recently been identified by scientific analysis. Qualitative elemental analysis of a small sample taken shows the presence of Al, Si, Ca and Fe with a strong presence of iron.The Freer|Sackler – Smithsonian’s Museums of Asian Art also houses also a collection of archival materials related to the modern exploration of Palmyra, among them a plan of the ruins, donated by Ernst Herzfeld (1879-1948). The plan was made shortly before Freer acquired the stone relief from Palmyra, with the ancient cemeteries indicated around the citywall, together with a series of glass negatives related to an expedition to Palmyra, carried out by Herzfeld’s colleague Moritz Sobernheim (1872-1933) in 1899. Sobernheim had photographed and made squeezes of some of the inscriptions, which later became part of Herzfeld’s collection and are available for research, documenting the very early stages of archaeological fieldwork in the ancient Near East.  The On the Polychromy of Ancient Palmyra and on Nomads and Networks in Ancient Kazakhstan in Washington DC by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The project (a collaboration between The Department of Prehistoric Archaeology at Aarhus University and Skanderborg Museum) has received a grant from the Carlsberg Foundation to begin a research project this summer. We are going to start out with two months of excavation.Once we get started I hope to be able to blog a little more about what we are doing on site – but for now I am looking forward to Monday and the start-up!You can read more about the project and Alken Wetlands on Skanderborg Museums website.Edit 3rd July 2012:The start-up of the excavation went well and the first press-release is out via Aarhus University.The Alken Wetlands: Peat and Bones by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"300"," I am the Chair of the City of London Archaeological Society. Like all our Officers and Committee I work unpaid and in my own time to help organise a thriving local society. My story my ring bells for many of the unsung band who make their contribution to archaeology by enthusing and supporting others.I did not have broadband at home for a long time, so the first thing I see when I log-on at work is ‘draft minutes’ of COLAS’s recent evening Committee meeting.Among the things we discussed (for the Nth time) the best place to put our money, a speaker who had changed his mind about coming, getting our laptop and projector to the July lecture, when the usual transporter (me) was on holiday and how to contact the members who may already have been trained to undertake fieldwork on the Thames Foreshore.However the big topic was our Tower of London Archaeology Weekend (26/27 May). Fifty one individual volunteers, putting in 80 volunteer days to provide a wide range of displays and activities for the public. Well that’s COLAS’s bit done for the ‘Big Society’.Following on from the Committee meeting, I take time at lunch to send out a few emails to remind people about stuff that needs to go into the July edition of our magazine ‘Context’. It is quarterly, so must include details of our August walk and an October guided visit to the wonderful Kensal Green Cemetery.  You need to think ahead in this job.I send the Editor a couple of hundred carefully crafted words about a small and almost unknown local museum I visited recently, and feel guilty that I have not yet done my ‘From the Chair’ piece.I remind myself, I need to follow up an invitation to visit a Museum of London Archaeology excavation.  When could I phone XX when she wouldn’t be down a hole somewhere?  I email Tower volunteers a couple of nice Tower pictures of themselves and answer a lot of phone calls and emails that ARE work related.Back home and fed, I wonder whether to watch TV or do a Context summary of COLAS’s last lecture; not an easy job, as it had a lot of pictures. Or both. Multitasking again.Eventually bed and dreaming of my forthcoming holiday.  What a joy digital photography is, so I do not have to pack slide film for that possible presentation for some future ‘members night’.Rose BaillieChairCity of London Archaeological Society The A Day in the Life of a Local Society Officer by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I was picked up by Land Rover and driven for 20 minutes with 3 colleagues (a land agent, architect and another archaeologist) out onto remote moorland to visit the ruins of a Victorian cottage which we are in the process of conserving in the Hoar Oak Valley. Following the site meeting two of us parted company with the others and trekked out further into the moor to do some assessment work on Exmoor’s Principal Archaeological Landscapes (PALs) which have been designated because of their exceptional historic and archaeological interest. Here we looked at the condition of medieval boundary stones which delineate the edge of the former Royal Forest of Exmoor. By now it was lunchtime and we ate our sandwiches within the earthworks of a Bronze Age roundhouse. As we did so, a large group of between 16 and 20 red deer emerged from Ruckham Combe, a deep valley below us. After lunch we headed off to find and assess the condition of other Bronze Age archaeology in this area, including another roundhouse, a stone row and several burial cairns.   By this stage it was time to head back to the car, which entailed a long walk over the moorland during which we came across the traces of old medieval field boundaries, peat cuttings and finally, a tiny stone-built bothy to shelter a shepherd in bad weather.   Boundary Stone and moorland Furzehill  Dr Lee Bray:The day started with a telephone discussion with a geophysical contractor concerning the initial results of a high-resolution magnetometry survey undertaken on a flint scatter site in advance of mire restoration. The focus was the possible interpretation of the anomalies identified by the survey. I then moved on to initial planning of mitigation measures necessary in response to geophysical results.  The remainder of the day was spent reading draft reports and drafting comments on walkover and metric survey on other mire restoration sites on Exmoor and on designing posters for an upcoming outreach event, highlighting the archaeology of mires including liaison with Exmoor National Park Designer, concerning poster layout and image sourcing. Janette at work  Janette Henderson:I’m a mature post-graduate student studying for an MA in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University.  I’m currently doing a six week work placement with Exmoor National Park and am just at the end of my fifth week.  One of the things I am doing as part of my placement is to design a couple of historic walk cards.  This is one of the methods that the Park will use to inform people about the archaeology on the moors.  Today I am making some changes to the text (route description and details of the archaeology) for the walk cards, looking for suitable images to go in them, checking a map produced in GIS, and liaising with IT to pull it all together.  I’m doing this mainly from my room in a B&B just outside Dulverton and the photographs which accompany this blog are of me sitting at my ‘desk’ in the B&B (taken by my landlady), and of the fantastic view of Exmoor from my bedroom window.  As you can see, I am surrounded by 50th birthday cards.  I recently celebrated (if ‘celebrated’ is the word) reaching that advanced age, and what a place to do it in!  Tonight a friend of mine is coming to visit for the weekend.  She doesn’t know it yet, but tomorrow she is going to be a guinea pig to test out the walk cards! The A Day of Archaeology on Exmoor by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"304","Friday was forecast to be an unseasonable bright and mild day as British summertime goes, with rain predicted for only half the day. I went into the office at the comparatively leisurely time of 9am, having been told the previous day that there were no sites I needed to attend. On arriving it seemed that phone calls had been received from a site, kindly but forcibly asking where the archaeologist was.  I then speedily received a Site Written Scheme of Investigation from a project manager, an address, a phone number to call when I got there and a had a brief meeting outlining what was to be done when I got there. I got together some boots and basic kit  and then hared down the road with all my clobber to catch a bus.Thankfully when I arrived on site it began to rain, and luckily I was locked out for long enough to cool off for a bit. The site was without its foreman for the day, but the onsite contractors were anxious to get started on reducing ground in a churchyard for a building extension; though the building had been designed to have a minimum footprint intrusion, it was likely that some disarticulated bones might be found.We began the ground reduction and soon found a large quantity of bones- which we carefully retrieved and placed in storage to be reburied. It became quickly evident that these bones had been deliberately placed in the area being excavated, probably by the builders when they disturbed burials during works nearby on site in the 1970′s. Among these bones we were very surprised to find a tiny lead coffin which had been placed with them. We carefully moved this with the bones to a safe place. On examination, we noticed an inscription on the coffin lid. I wrote this down and photographed it.The excavation went on all day, punctuated with refreshing showers.When I returned to the office, I consulted a website archive with the colleague I had been providing cover for. I was very surprised to find the name on the coffin in the records. It seems that the baby- who had sadly passed away aged only 15 days, had been buried two days later and a couple with the same surname- possibly parents, were recorded as living on the same street as the church. The profession and surname of the man were closely associated with the area and its immigrant population, the man being a weaver of Huguenot descent. On further searching, I was pleased to see that this couple had a child two years after the death of the baby we found, who hopefully survived into adulthood.The Danny Harrison: Senior Archaeologist on a Former Churchyard Site by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"305","Its the third season for the field school and community archaeology project at Blackfriary, Trim, Co. Meath.  Blackfriary is a 13th century friary, the buildings were sold off for stone the 18th however sub-surface foundations and other features still survive and archaeological excavation is ongoing to discover extent of these. Photo  1   Exposed masonry on siteToday, the 29th of June, ends the fifth week of season three at Blackfriary. The season has been flying in and we have already seen a number of students come and go. We are nearly half way through the season with only six weeks left on site for 2012.The excavation at Blackfriary is also part of a community archaeology project; the field school works alongside the local council and community groups to provide a programme of events to engage the local community with the project, from understanding the archaeology of the site to integrating the Blackfriary as part of the Trim townscape.As an intern with the IAFS the first thing I have learned is that no day on site is ever the same! This is due to the coming together of different groups of people from schools groups to students, and from local visitors to tourists (as well as the unpredictable Irish summer weather).On a daily basis the field school teaches students the skills and techniques for excavating features along with skills such as planning and drawing that help to record finds and features and assisting in the archiving of the site. Another key learning outcome for non-Irish students is how to make the perfect pot of tea!Photo 2  Students practicing excavation and recording skillsThe second thing I have learned as an intern at the Blackfriary is to be prepared for a lot of bones (and it’s a good thing that I’m not squeamish)!On site, to date, there have been nine burials found, and countless amounts of disarticulated human bone. We had a resident bio-archaeologist on site for the month of June, Professor Rachel Scott of Arizona State University. Photo 3 Contemplating an infant  burialShe gave a module on  bio-archaeology and osteoarchaeology, teaching students the techniques to excavate, record and process human remains. Following this module, one of our students, Anna from Macalester College, was able to give a presentation to a groups of forty plus high school students visiting from the USA, presenting and explaining the bones found on site. Photo 4  Excavation in progress – Rachel and the infant burial Photo  5   A presentation on bones to studentsThe site is located in the centre of a housing estate which many people walk past or use to walk their dogs on a daily basis. This means there is a lot of interaction with residents of the local community and a common part of a days dig can be showing locals around the site and explaining to them both what is being excavated and being found. Photo  6   Giving visiting high school a tour of the siteA further mix of interactions is with tourists who visit the site through Cultural Tourism Ireland. Through CTI members of the public with an interest in heritage and archaeology come on site and experience the process of excavation for themselves.Throughout the dig the coming together of this large and diverse group of international budding archaeologists, Irish students, local community members, site visits from school children and those with a keen and common interest in the heritage of Ireland adds to (and in my opinion enriches) the experience of being on site. Photo  7   Blackfriary crew in actionCaroline Henry, Heritage Intern with the Irish Archaeology Field School: reporting for Day of Archaeology 2012 The An Intern’s Experience/My First Excavation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"306","My name is David Rotenizer and I am the site manager of the Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex (GCMAC) in Moundsville, West Virginia. I have held the position for one month shy of three years.  Archaeology has been an important part of my life since 1978, though mostly in the field.  My current position is particularly important to me because it helps with what I feel to be one of the field’s most important functions – to share the fruits of archaeology with the public.  Before proceeding with my day in the life perspective, I need to present a little background on where I work.GCMAC is a seven acre archaeological park featuring the Grave Creek Mound.  We are a historic site operated by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.  It is called a complex because we consist of three separate, but related components:  mound, museum, and research facility.  The Grave Creek Mound is one of the largest known conical earthen burial mounds associated with the Adena culture and has been dated to around 250 – 150 BCE.Interpretive Garden at Base of Grave Creek MoundThe Delf Norona Museum is a modern 25,646 square foot facility that opened in 1978.  It features various exhibit galleries, a 136-seat auditorium, an activity room for educational programs, and a gift shop.  Outside on the grounds is one of our newest “exhibits” – an interpretive garden.A gallery area within museum. Diaorama witin gallery depicting Grave Creek Mound.  Detail of Timeline within Gallery. View of the Grave Creek Mound from Museum. View toward portion of gift shop.In 2008, a new state-of-the-art wing opened which houses the West Virginia Archaeological Research and Collections Management Facility.  The 9,600 square foot addition serves as West Virginia’s first official repository for the state’s archaeological collections.Observation Window looking into Archaeological Lab. Portion of one of 51 shelving units at facility – each about 8m (26 ft)long. Portion of the Research Library and Archives.We are open seven days a week, but to the public for six.  We currently have a staff of five full time employees and are blessed to be supported by a small group of dedicated regular volunteers.My day actually began the evening before when we hosted our monthly lecture and film series program.  June always features a presentation and tour of the interpretive garden.  A typical day usually starts out with ensuring the facility is ready to be visited by the public starting at 9 a.m.  You want to make sure the lights are on, doors unlocked, restrooms are acceptable, trash emptied and if need be the glass doors and display cases cleaned and to check floors that may need to be swept or vacuumed.  The cash register in the gift shop is made ready and items stocked if needed.  Due to our limited staff everyone must wear different hats to keep the facility operational. We all help each other.Throughout the day, I spend a lot of time on the computer checking and responding to e-mails, and on phone calls.  During the day I also check with the different staff members to keep abreast of what they are working on and to provide whatever support they might need.  Today I spent time working on submitted bids for annual maintenance of the mound and preparing supply orders, and reviewing gift shop inventory, to be ready when the new fiscal year starts on 1 July.  I was in communication with the Native American Studies Program at West Virginia University which will be bringing a class of volunteers to assist us in the lab in a few weeks – lots of last minute details to finalize.   A team from state technology services was here to help with the installation of a server to back up the records and files of the research facility.  I was in contact with the agency’s State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) education and planning coordinator to discuss ideas for West Virginia Archaeology Month held in October.  In August the street in front of the facility will be closed for several days due to a Veteran’s Wall project and I needed to respond to a request that had come in for use of our property to host a first-aid tent.During the day I helped to greet visitors who arrive, and provide a brief orientation for them.  It is always interesting to meet folks and learn where they are from – amazingly from all over the U.S. and lately Canada and Germany.  It is equally interesting to listen to their questions and their experiences and perceptions of archaeology. Time was spent running the cash register in the gift shop.  Archaeological publications and gemstones/minerals are our best sellers. When I restocked the brochure rack I noticed we were almost out of our Cahokia Mounds brochure and called there to order more.  I had to make a daily run to the post office to deliver and pick up our mail as well as make trip to the bank to deposit funds from gift shop sales and fee-based educational programs. I walked the property to ensure everything was in good order.  The men’s public restroom had to be briefly closed while I gave it a special cleaning.  An artifact was brought to my attention for interpretation.At the end of the day I close out the cash register and prepare a daily revenue report and then we go through the process of closing and securing the facility.  Like all of the positions here, no two days are the same.  It is always a matter of multi-tasking and dealing with the issues at hand.  All the same, we are part of the global archaeological community doing our part to interpret, preserve, and protect the past for present and future generations. The A Day in the Life of a Historic Site/Museum/Research Facility Manager in West Virginia by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"307","On the 29th of June I was digging in Százhalombatta (Hungary) in the middle of a Bronze Age tell, where there has been continuous habitation from c. 2200 BC to c. 1800 BC (Nagyrév and Vatya cultures) and a 4.5 m deep stratigraphy was formed.It is a training and research dig and although I am a Roman specialist, the site director invited me, together with other more experienced diggers, to take part in the season.So what was my day like? I have spent my day in the 20 x 20 m trench and delicately excavated and recorded a 1 x 1 m grid inside a Bronze Age house. I have only removed a couple of cm, but in a tell like that, this is a usual amount of work you can do within one working day.  Also there was a lot of sampling, and we sieve every bucket, we are even collecting every pebble!The dig will run till the end of July, and you can find out more information here.The Digging a Tell by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"308","There was a big contrast between this day’s morning and afternoon.  A large project, renewing all pipes and drains and the street, as well as implementing a district heating system is underway in the medieval town of Unterseen, Switzerland.  A small team from the Archaeological Service of the Canton of Berne is investigating the archaeology as it is being exposed by the building work.  Mechanical diggers and all sorts of building machines serve around us as hole after hole are opened and closed at an unrelenting pace.  We do a combination of a watching brief and a more traditional excavation. It is a complex construction site, one of the most challenging I have worked on.  There are many partners (firms and authorities) on site; there is little space in the old town centre for all these people and their material.  Besides, the many shops and restaurant lining the street suffer greatly from the extended work during the main tourist season.It is thus essential that the archaeology delays the building work as little as possible.  To be able to allow some traffic we only truly excavate one of the 16 small fields (7x9m) at once.  For the remaining area we react to the construction work.  That means we document the archaeology as the builders open new sections of trenches, after which the building continues and the archaeology gets destroyed.  We thus strictly limit ourselves to excavating and recording only that which is threatened to be destroyed.  It a stressful project and only possible at all – as is so often the case – through good and intense communication between the local authorities, the various building partners and the Archaeological Service.  The scientific results are fantastic though, considering the way we work.©Archaeological Service Canton Berne. June 2012.– Niche in a medieval wall in Unterseen, Switzerland.We have been able to confirm the old suspicion that during medieval times, the town was not yet characterised by the `Stadthaus´ and the surrounding open spaces as it is today.  Instead we now know that, at least along the eastern side of the town, a narrow alley lined by densely packed rows of houses allowed traffic to pass through the town from gate to gate.  Of these houses, we only find the cellars.  The stone-built cellar walls are often plastered.  Some even twice, showing not only the care with which they were constructed, but also their extended use and the way they were cared for.  Stairs leading down into them and wall-niches for lamps and candles further help to bring the medieval occupation of Unterseen to life.These new finds, however, also raise new questions.  The building work does not reach the depth of the cellar floors and it is here most finds are to be expected.  As a result it remains unknown for now what these cellars, and the houses above them, were used for.  Without finds it is also difficult to date them precisely.  However, from historical sources we know much of the small market town was destroyed by fire in 1470AD. After that it was decided not to rebuild the central part of the town, but leave open spaces surrounding a large trading house, the precursor of the current `Stadthaus’.  And indeed we see many signs of fire on the remaining cellar walls and the rubble that fills them. So it is likely the cellars date between the city’s founding in 1279AD and 1470AD.In the afternoon I was able to meet up with a colleague to talk about the start of a next project.  Summer 2010 I was involved in another rescue archaeology project in Andermatt and Hospental just below the Gotthardpass in Switzerland.  On the site of a future golf-course, at ca. 1500masl (which must be almost finished now), we discovered a number of archaeological features, dating from the Late Mesolithic (ca.6000BC) to Early Modern Times.  The Canton of Uri, who is responsible, has now provided funds for a small post-excavation project.  We were able to excavate part of the Late Mesolithic site, Hospental-Moos, before its destruction and this now forms the heart of the project.Mesolithic sites are relatively seldom in Switzerland and in the Alps.  But archaeologists are becoming more and more aware of the prehistoric occupation and use of the Alps.  Slowly we see more research and even rescue archaeology in the Alps.  Until 2010 no Late Mesolithic sites were known at this altitude in central Switzerland, which makes this site rather special.  The fact that practically all artefacts are made of rock crystal makes it even more special.  I am very thrilled to be able to analyse these finds.In a quiet office, we discussed which of the many samples we had taken on site are to be analysed further. Especially at sites of this nature, it is not just the finds and the features that allow us to paint an accurate picture of the past: Soil samples can help us explain the built-up of the soil.  Charred plant remains such as seeds, e.g. from hearths, might tell us about what people ate. And like pollen-samples from the soil they can also teach us about the vegetation around the site at the time of occupation.  Charcoal samples, often also from hearths, can be used to date the site’s habitation.So my day started on a hectic construction site, where I try to unravel the development of a 13-15th Century market town.  It finished in a quiet office, discussing the last hunter-gatherer societies of the Alps and their environment ca. 7000 years earlier.  A challenging and varied Swiss Day of Archaeology!The A Day in Swiss Rescue Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"309","A Late Bronze Age cremation urn from Gosmore, south of Hitchin: no-one would quibble about this being a display of archaeology © North Hertfordshire District CouncilMy third post is about Hitchin Museum, the second of the two run by North Hertfordshire District Council. When the council was established in 1974, it took over museums from the former Letchworth Urban District and Hitchin Urban District Councils. Rather than duplicate the coverage in both places, it was decided that Letchworth Museum would concentrate on Natural History and Archaeology, while Hitchin’s permanent displays would deal with Social History and Costume (to which were subsequently added militaria, in the form of the Hertfordshire Yeomanry collection, and a Victorian pharmacy from the old Perks and Llewllyn’s shop in Hitchin, together with the collection of the Hertfordshire Pharmaceutical Trust).A few years ago, I decided to add some archaeological material to the social history gallery that deals largely with the history of Hitchin. To that end, I put on display some Lower Palaeolithic hand axes, Neolithic tools, a Bronze Age cremation urn and a group of Late Iron Age and Romano-British pots from cremation burials. This created a case dealing with the period before the town began to develop. A second case already contained some medieval material (most notably an attractive encaustic floor tile from St Mary’s parish church and a ridge tile decorated with a three-dimensional horseman from the former Brotherhood guildhall on Bancroft, dating from 1475); to this, I added a late sixth-century globular jar from Gosmore and a skull from one of the sixth-century burials excavated on Queen Street in 2001. This, strangely, is the period when Hitchin seems to have developed as a community.A medieval ridge tile from The Brotherhood (2-4 Bancroft, Hitchin), depicting a rider on horseback: fifteenth century in date, but is it archaeology or social history? © North Hertfordshire District CouncilAdding these last items to an existing display raised all sorts of questions for me. Why were the tile and horseman considered social history objects rather than archaeological? There are other contemporary items (such as some attractive fifteenth-century wooden ceiling bosses from Hitchin or a ninth-century silver linked pin) that have made their way into the archaeological collections (and are consequently currently on display in Letchworth Museum). Why were they not seen as items that illustrate the social history of the town? After all, the linked pin is contemporary with Æthelgifu, a wealthy local woman, whose still extant will records gifts to the church in Hitchin, which she refers to as “my Minster“.I comes down, in the end, to specialisms. In archaeology, we are beset by the problem of period specialisation. We have people who deal with Roman pottery, with Bronze Age metalwork, with post-medieval tile (well, perhaps not so many of the latter), whose professional lives rarely bring them into contact with each other. Such specialisms are a necessary evil – we need experts to deal with different classes of material – but they lead to a compartmentalisation that can make the labels we apply to the past appear more clear-cut than they really are. Nobody woke up in 2200 BCE and decided that they were no longer in the Neolithic and that therefore everything had to change. Nevertheless, we retain these labels because they are useful: Neolithic societies were different from those of the Bronze Age, but not in the sense that they changed overnight from one to the other.A twentieth-century object, a mug commemorating the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953: few would disagree with classing this as social history © North Hertfordshire District CouncilIt is the same in museums. We have specialisms within museums. The Keeper of Fine Art may be responsible for the fine post-medieval ceramics (such as collections of Royal Doulton), while the Keeper of Social History may be responsible for the local earthenwares. Unless, of course, these items were found during excavations, in which case they will most likely be the responsibility of the Keeper of Archaeology. This highlights the artificial nature of these divisions. Is Social History just Archaeology with documents, or is Archaeology just Social History with objects? Either way, museums tend to use objects to illustrate both Social History and Archaeology because that is the nature of museums: they are repositories for objects (which may include documents, but that is very much a secondary function).So, where does archaeology fit into a museum like Hitchin Museum? Insofar as the history of the town extends back to a period before any records survive, we can only deal with its social history through archaeological data sets. In the majority of places, the earliest centuries of a community’s existence lack all documentation and can only be reconstructed using the surviving material culture and other archaeological evidence. By separating this off from “Social History”, though, we create an impression that there are fixed dividing lines in the past and, more worryingly, that the true “history” of a place only begins when we have surviving records. I get the impression that archaeologists still have a long way to go before we convince historians, let alone the general public, that this is not the case.The Hitchin Museum: Social History & Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"311","I work as a researcher at the School of Archaeology, University of Oxford.  My job is to look after the GIS elements of a large (ERC funded), 5 year project to study the English landscape from 1500BC to AD 1086, which we call the EngLaId project.  For any who don’t know, GIS stands for Geographic(al) Information Systems (or sometimes Science) and it is, essentially, computer software that lets you create maps and analyse data in its spatial context (to cut a long story short!).  Our project is using GIS as one of the tools in its armoury in order to try to understand continuity and change in the English rural landscape over the period of 2,500 years from the Middle Bronze Age to Domesday.  My job mostly involves bringing together a large number of pre-existing datasets within GIS software (specifically, ArcGIS) and trying to find patterns and trends over time.ArcGIS. Spatial data: contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2012 (OS OpenData)However, Friday was not a day that involved a lot of GIS work for me.  Two of my colleagues on the EngLaId team work at the University’s eResearch Centre (OeRC).  During the morning, a few of us went over to the OeRC to meet with them and a Professor of Visualisation (Min Chen) and his team.  We had a long and interesting discussion about innovative ways of visualising data.  Prof Chen made a distinction between the two purposes of visualisation: to enable better academic understanding and exploration of data and to enhance public presentation of data.  The former is where his team’s research interests lie and they have done some fascinating work on creating ‘glyphs’ to display multiple data attributes at once.  The previous time we met with him, Prof Chen had shown us a series of glyphs that described the behaviour of sperm, which was most memorable for the erratic travel paths of the sperm found in ‘rats on drugs’!  The meeting ended with me being invited to take part in a workshop on geospatial visualisation at the end of August.I returned to my office for a couple of hours, ate some lunch, and set my computer to running some GIS tools.  I then returned to the OeRC after lunch, leaving my processing processing, for our biweekly EngLaId team meeting.  We normally meet here at the School of Archaeology, but the building is being partly rewired over the summer, so there is currently no space to hold meetings here.  The team meeting lasted until after four o’clock, and seemed to be productive.When we got back to the office, my colleague was told there was in a rat in her office (presumably disturbed by the builders), but I don’t think this rat was on drugs…  As it had been a long day, the pub beckoned, so we swiftly adjourned to there.  I had to return to the office later to check on my GIS processing (and pick up my bike), which had completed by that time.Friday wasn’t really a typical day for me, as I am more usually found working at the computer in our attic office.  But it was a fairly productive day over all, despite the relative lack of normal work.  If anybody wants to know more about EngLaId, then please feel free to check out our own blog.The Academic Research: A Day of Meetings… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

All very interesting.  It has been a lot of work to organise.The day before, Thursday,  I had the chance to visit the Time Team excavation in a local town which was rather fabulous, had a chat with Tim Taylor (what a nice man).  The day after the 29th, I had co-organised a visit for the CBA (Council for British Archaeology) East Midlands to the Prebendal Manor at Nassington which was a great success, lovely weather, lunch, Manor and walk to a site of an Anglo-Saxon burial ground.  We had 35 members attend the day and the star of the show was ‘cat’ sitting in the window of the 15th Century Manor!The Definitely Not a Typical Day For Me! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"313","I am a staff archaeologist for a small private archaeology firm based in Salt Lake City, Utah, but given the economic and development climate almost all of our contracts are in Nevada. Today’s work settles us in south-central Utah, Cedar City, with our project area located nearly one and a half hours to the west on the Utah/Nevada border. Why so far away? Well, the distinct lack of hotels closer to the project area is the primary cause!The day starts as usual with a 7am rise and shine, with everyone meeting at the rig, archaeological parlance for abused and smelly vehicle. This is day 9 of a 10-day field session, so close to the end we can taste it…and smell it…oh nope that is the rig. We are down to two folks, a eager go-getter with a Bachelor’s from the University of Utah and a straw hat that would put Huckleberry Finn to shame, and myself, a Historical Archaeologist with a Ph.D. from the University of Montana, with a field hat that has seen too many years of sweat and soil and is an old friend now. Regardless of our educational status, age, or even field hat coolness, we both need an instant infusion of caffeine.An Archaeologists’ Hat is as much an indicator of professionalism as his trowel. As such this hat has been my travel companion since 2004, the year of my first archaeological job.A short drive to downtown Cedar City, brings us to one of the two coffee shops in town. Religious prohibitions on caffeine definitely cuts into the morning options in rural Utah.  With a 20oz iced soy mocha in hand we hit the road, still trying to clear the fogginess of an eighth night in a hotel. Regardless of season, crew size, project, weather, or impending days off, the morning drive is usually a shorter drive than the afternoon. After listening to some archaeological theory lectures through an ipod, we cross the barren sagebrush flats of the Escalante Desert, still in Utah and still an hour out. Oddly, the Escalante Desert is home to one of the largest pig farms in the United States, and by the pungent odor permeating our rig, locals apparently use the by-products of the facility (poop) for the smattering of agricultural fields that dot the valley bottom.Wild Horses Roam Freely in the Project AreaFinally, after passing a railroad ghost town of the 1920s, we turn onto a dirt road, finally making the last desperate plunge into the project area. Conversation has now completely died, as everything that was worth saying has been said, and now thoughts turn to the work at hand….pop…there goes a tire…changed in 14 minutes, new record. As soon as we start again we encounter a wild herd of horses, roaming freely across the rugged mountains now covered in a Pinyon-Juniper Woodland. We take some time to capture their free spirits on our company’s digital camera, and their skittishness makes for excellent action photos.  Today is the third day of “Red Flag” warnings in Utah and eastern Nevada, defined by high heat and high wind. One perk, which is apparently my pithy catchphrase of choice according to my straw-hatted colleague, of a “Red Flag” day is that the wind offsets some of the oppressive 99 degree heat.Finally, upon reaching our project area we unload the car and start the processing of conducting archaeological survey. Simply put, we wander in organized lines through defined areas looking for remnants of the past, whether it is chipped stone from Native American use up to 13,000 years ago, or cone-top beer cans of the 1930s. In the United States, all sites older than 50 years must be recorded during survey, thus even making songs like “The Twist”, “I Can’t Stop Loving You”, and “Duke of Earl” now a historic part of America’s past.We are currently working for a mineral exploration company, who is looking for traces of fortune in these desolate mountains. In 1899, these same mountains saw their first mining boom, which quickly fizzled into abandoned ruins and trash of hundreds of disappointed miners. This trash is exactly what makes me excited for our job, as these cans, bottles, ceramics, corset hooks, buttons, and a million other small things forgotten, tell us a story of who lived here, how they lived, what they ate, what was their ethnicity, and sometimes if we get lucky, their gender, age, and perhaps even name. All archaeologists, regardless of their location, age, or position, are bound together by this common thrill of discovery. The unknown is what gets me up in the morning.Half Stone, Half Log Cabin Sits Peacefully and Poses for PhotoAfter arriving on-site by 9am, we start the process of identifying one of the five sites we will record today. It is a large mineral prospecting site dating to the 1890s-1910s boom period. We identify several building platforms, a privy, two dumps, and over a dozen mining features from adits (horizontal mine shafts) to prospect holes. After nearly 20 days of recording sites in this area, we start to see patterns in the trash people disposed of, and this gives us an idea of what they ate on-site.My focus is on the lowly sardine can, a common fixture of any mining camp in the American West. While I find the smell, texture, and perhaps even packaging of this small fish as pleasurable as the pig farms we just drove through, it was a common source of protein for miners isolated in the mountains. More interestingly, though, I notice that we can tell that there was some consumer preference for these stinky little fish in one camp versus another. The site we are recording today has only two sardine cans in a dump of 400 cans. Yesterday we recorded over 50 cans in a similarly-sized dump. Apparently a kindred spirit of sardine-dislike occupied this camp over 100 years ago. Another camp, this time occupied during the Great Depression (1930s), also contained a boatload of sardine cans, though these all showed signs of burning. Yep, someone decided not only to eat this product, but also cook it within the tin can it was purchased within. Health and palate concerns aside, these small patterns of trash keep the mind going over the course of a 10-hour field day.By 3:30pm, we have recorded another two small mining sites (thankfully devoid of further sardine cans), and two prehistoric sites composed completely of obsidian, which is black volcanic glass. There is a local obsidian quarry, so this black glass is found everywhere in great abundance. Interesting of course…but as we pile in the rig to head home…my mind still ponders the lowly sardine, and how we seem like sardines ourselves squeezed into a vehicle filled to the seams with equipment, water, backpacks, a now flat tire, and the other trappings of archaeology.The return drive is far less eventful, and far less filled with theoretical conversations. Focus is instead on the evening’s pursuit of nourishment, fried food and a beer (definitely not cooked sardines!). After a gentle avoiding swerve of a jackrabbit attempting to speed up Darwinism, we hit the pavement and tear off for the comfort of hotel and bar in Cedar City. We close the work day with a banana and strawberry flavored snow cone from a child labor operated roadside stand, and hit the showers. Tomorrow is a short day, only a four hour drive to home, and then the four hours of paperwork. After a seemingly short four days off, we hit the road again for another archaeological adventure in Nevada. The A Day in the Life of Contract Archaeology in Nevada & Utah by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"314","My Day of Archaeology 2012 has been an exciting one, as my volunteers arrived on site for the first time, not to dig, but to make a movie.I am the lucky archaeologist leading Project Florence, a community project aiming to get local residents involved in spreading the word about an exciting army excavation taking place on Salisbury Plain. This excavation is part of Operation Nightingale, a rehabilitation programme for wounded soldiers.One of our key aims for the project is for volunteers to produce a DVD about the excavation as a record of the dig and to provide a legacy for Operation Nightingale. The volunteers, aged between 14 and 25, are being trained by professional film-makers to plan, film and edit the movie, which will be premiered at the Salisbury Arts Centre (SAC) in November.Today was the first day of filming on site, following training sessions at SAC last week, and we were all eager to start catching the action. As I have no experience of movie-production, I am making the most of the chance to learn some new skills along with my volunteers. We are all working towards an Arts Award certificate.We started our after-school training session with the basics, running over the things we learnt last week like how to frame the shot and how to find the best angle. Our ever-patient instructors, Jamie and Simon, explained that we need to take a mixture of interviews and ‘pretty pictures’ to stick together in the edit. So, we set about filming wide shots of trench activity, interviews with the archaeologists and soldiers, and close ups of interesting finds, so far including an Anglo-Saxon brooch and some amber beads. Our highlight of the day was getting to film one of the soldiers, Al, and his son Ben, lifting the most complete skeleton on site so far.At the end of a busy two hours, I asked the group what they thought of the session:“I found the archaeology interesting and liked learning about excavation and watching the skeleton being lifted.” Matt, 17“I really enjoyed learning to use the sound equipment today, especially the boom. I can’t wait to put all our shots together to make the DVD!” Jess, 15To find out more about both Project Florence and Operation Nightingale check out our blog – click hereLaura JoynerProject Florence OfficerWessex Archaeology The Lights, Camera, Action! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"316","I have to admit, first off, that I’m not an archaeologist; not qualified as such and never dug in my life… (my experience is in historic building research and analysis; but that’s a different kind of archaeology I suppose!) My job title doesn’t suggest anything either – ‘Project Officer’ – I added the ‘brackets Historic Environment’ bit so people would (sort of) know what I do…I am currently maternity covering for an osteoarchaeologist who has done a sterling job over the last couple of years organising local history and archaeology projects for the Tamar Valley AONB, getting people involved in looking at and understanding their local landscape.Friday was not a typical day. Got to work at 8.30 and grabbed a lift with our new manager, Corinna, to Liskeard to a HELM training event on the NPPF (one of my aims of this blog is to get as many abbreviations and acronyms in as possible..!). I’m not really one for planning, policy and all that, but it was actually rather good. When I worked at EH I was constantly up to date with policy; now after 6 months in this job I’ve started to feel a little out of the loop, and it was good to get back on track with the terminology, paragraph numbers, and discussions about uPVC windows. AONB policy only came a up a couple of times but it’s good to be informed about the wider picture.Back to the office for 2pm. What to do now on a Friday afternoon? Replied to some emails (nothing that exciting) and finished some guidance notes for my hedge surveyors. We are running a big project at the moment searching for significant hedges in the Tamar Valley. Most of our volunteers are involved as they have skills in species identification, and my job is to get them thinking about the history of hedges, and their contribution to the character of the landscape. The history section of the survey sheet has been puzzled over by some, and left blank a few times too! I’ve reassessed it and realised that some of the questions are a bit intense (we don’t have the resources to make every hedge survey ever done in West Devon and East Cornwall available to our volunteers, for example). I could spend hours pouring over old maps and interrogating the HERs, and being amazed by the patterns hedges make in the landscape, but I’m likewise impressed by the skills of the volunteers to identify up to 120 different species of plant in a 30m stretch of hedge!My colleague (and some say half of the SB/SB double act) Simon came back from a site visit at 4pm; his daughter Jennie has been with us all week on work experience. Lucky her – beats working in a shop! Had a brief chat about what I’m up to this week as he is on Jury Service, and then decided to call it a day and get back home for happy hour in my local (it is Friday after all!).Jennie took lots of photos of the Tamar Valley and posted them on our Facebook page.

"317","These last couple of weeks have seen the biggest changes that Worcester Museum has witnessed since the 1890s. We have shared our current building with Worcester Public Library since 1896 and before that, a building across the street, but during June 2012 they have moved out of our beautiful Victoria Institute  into Worcester’s new HIVE building.Consequently my day of archaeology has been about new and exciting developments as the museum expands into the library space, our new temporary displays and helping our colleagues as they get the HIVE ready to open on July 2nd 2012.Our new temporary exhibition at the museum is designed for our summer audience and is all about fantasy, film, brave princesses, honourable knights and really beautiful Anglo Saxon archaeology from our collections. We don’t have very many Anglo Saxon artefacts and those that we do have were collected by Victorian antiquarians in the main. Our technicians have been building and installing the exhibition all week – big oak doorways, crows with beady eyes, heavy iron chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. We are installing the artefacts today. There is a cruciform brooch, disc brooches and amber beads from Upton Snodsbury, a scabbard chape and spearhead from Bredons Norton, pottery, shield bosses and a beautiful Anglo Saxon bucket from Bidford on Avon that was excavated in the 1920s. Our local archaeological society, Worcestershire Archaeological Society have sponsored the exhibition for us – part of their mandate to become more involved in archaeological work of all types in the county.Anglo Saxon artefacts from Bidford upon Avon in the new Legend exhibitionDownstairs in the space that the library used to occupy we have installed a fourth plinth (a bit like the Trafalgar Square one but shorter) and today’s residency is called Quilos and the Windmill. There is masking tape all over the plinth and it continues to grow. It’s called sitewriting and I understand it’s to do with mapping experiences and daydreams and the like. I don’t entirely understand it but I’m pleased to say that most of those around me absolutely do. We usually walk through this space without a thought but during the fourth plinth project we have a webcam filming the whole thing including the staff!Worcester Fourth PlinthThe rest of my day is spent at The HIVE. This huge gold building that has sprung up in Worcester over the last year or so is opening on Monday. Our colleagues in Worcestershire Archive and Archaeology Service, Worcester Public Library and Worcester University Library have all moved into the new space. We are working on the content for the display cases. We have been given the theme of memory and we are filling cases full of nostalgia, the results of research projects and items from the collections of museums across Worcestershire. My favourite part of the displays are quotes from some of the County’s custodians of memory – the archaeologists, archivists, curators and researchers who are so passionate about what they do have been kind enough to tell us why they do what they do and why they love it. The results have been poignant and inspiring. The curator of the new Infirmary Museum talks about her responsibility to those who lost husbands, wives and parents in her ex-hospital building, The curator of Kidderminster Railway Museum describes himself as a young boy looking through the steam into the cab of an engine wishing he could be a train driver and our archivist describes the excitement and anticipation he feels when he opens a package of papers for the first time in 200 years to see what lies within it.Hal Dalwood, Worcestershire Archaeology at the HIVEAs we leave on Friday we are exhausted but Worcester is feeling like a place full of potential for heritage services at the moment – the new HIVE building is daring and ambitious and we who are staying put in our Foregate Street building have new space and new projects and lots to look forward to.The Everybody’s Changing … by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"318","Although we are zooarchaeologists, not a single archaeological animal bone has passed across our desks this week! Instead we’ve been working on sector support projects. Today we have been working on the Animal Bones and Archaeology Guidelines. This is one of the English Heritage guidelines for best practice in archaeological science, which we will be publishing in 2013. The Guidelines will provide advice about how to ensure that due consideration is given to the information potential, recovery and analysis of animal bones from archaeological projects, from the start of a project to final archiving of animal bones, and publication. It covers general project management, field and laboratory procedures (sampling, assessment, analysis and archiving of animal bones), and general methodological (for example, taxonomic identification or biometry) and specialist taxonomic sections (eg. small mammals and amphibians, bird bones, fish). The specialist sections have been written by colleagues working in a range of universities, and archaeological units, along with some sections we’ve written ourselves. They have all now mostly been submitted and we are beavering away on management and procedural sections. We are planning on holding a preliminary review of the Guidelines at the next PZG (Professional Zooarchaeology Group) meeting planned for Saturday, July 14th, so working hard to get it all pulled together in time!The ‘Animal Bones and Archaeology’ guidelines will be part of the series of English Heritage guidelines for archaeological science.For us the PZG is one of the highlights of our role within zooarchaeology. It’s an interest group, which we’ve helped coordinate from its inception about seven years ago. It now has about 80 members, all animal bone specialists working in the commercial, academic and public sectors (have a look here if you’d like further information on the group). We meet twice a year to study a particular topic, often taught by members themselves, with anywhere from around 15 to 25 members attending. The meetings consist of seminars and practical hands-on work, short presentations of particular case studies, of work recently completed or in progress by members (employer agreement permitting!), and we also hold a mini taxonomic workshop, during which we review the identification criteria for distinct taxa and run blind tests, just to keep us on our toes!Shetland rams at Lerwick Market, photographed by Sebastian PayneWe are hosting the forthcoming PZG, so another of today’s tasks was administration and planning for the meeting. Its taxonomic workshop will focus on distinguishing sheep and goats’ bones and teeth – they are more similar than you might think! Over the years, focused studies have identified several criteria, which can tell them apart, so today we have been compiling worksheets which draw together relevant references that we’ll use at the workshop to test out the criteria on some our reference skeletons. In the afternoon of the meeting we’re planning a visit to the Iron Age farm at Butser, where Peter Reynolds originally set up different experiments in Iron Age husbandry.  We’ll have a tour of the structures and activities, and in the evening Butser is also holding the Lughnasa festival.  Who says you can’t combine work and play!The Writing About Bones by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"319","This is the first ‘Day of Archaeology’ that we (Eastbourne Ancestors) have taken part in and so we are quite excited to be involved!I’m also excited as this is my first full time job in archaeology as the Project Co-ordinator for Eastbourne Ancestors. I work in the commercial world of archaeology as an osteoarchaeologist (human and animal remains) in my spare time too, as well as excavating with a local society and the Eastbourne Museum Service. Archaeology is for everyone and I strongly believe in the community aspect, getting hands on.You can follow our progress here: http://www.facebook.com/EastbourneAncestorsAlthough the ‘Day of Archaeology 2012′ fell on 29th June, I was in meetings which wouldn’t have made for exciting reading…but today is a different story.We are a Heritage Lottery Funded project run by the Eastbourne Museum Service in East Sussex. Our aim is to To fully examine all the human skeletal remains in our collection from the Eastbourne area in order to produce a demographic profile of the past populations that were living here.The skeletal analysis will include determining the age, biological sex, stature, metric and non-metric traits, ancestry, health, diet, handedness and evidence of pathology. We will also be conducting research into migration studies using isotope analysis, physical appearance using facial reconstruction and family connections, DNA and C14.As part of this project, we will be giving volunteers the opportunities to participate in artefact conservation, osteoarchaeology workshops, field work, study days, talks and demonstrations and much more. We will conclude the project with academic and public published material as well as an exhibition.On Friday, Jo (the boss) and I took a road trip to Bournemouth University to deliver 30 skeletons to students to study for their MSc dissertations. We also have a student from Exeter University studying clavicles for two weeks with us for her research. In a few months time we will be taking some of the collection to Canterbury University to be studied by their MSc and BSc students too.Today is our first volunteer day, we have 5 volunteers busily cleaning skeletal remains from an Anglo-Saxon cemetery site in Eastbourne. Each day for a month, volunteers will be helping to get the remains ready for analysis, which they will also receive training for as part of the Project.By the 2013 ‘Day of Archaeology’ I hope to have some interesting findings to write about: Where did these people come from? Are they local? How did they live and die? What did they wear? What did they look like?The Eastbourne Ancestors Day of Archaeology 2012 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

It always gets quite hectic on the last day and I finally got on the train at 6:30 and was home by 10:30, still sweaty and muddy! As such Friday morning wasn’t an early one for me and the day consisted of office bits and pieces. First up was finances: I don’t know if it’s because of the recession but more and more clients are grumbling about having to pay! I had to check to see if money had been paid in and go through some timesheets for another job to confirm we were on site. Second up was GIS: we are involved in a development which might have quite a high impact on the landscape and we are using GIS models to work out the impact areas. I had picked out a few clusters of important features on high ground and the client wanted shapefiles to show where they were. Another client wanted shapefiles to show where the early foundations of a Listed Building may remain on a development site so that he could design foundations around them. The final job of the day was proof reading. All the reports our company, produces are proof read and edited to make sure they making sense and there are no mitsakes.   I was looking over a Desk Based Assessment which is a report that assesses the potential for archaeological remains on a possible development site. The research suggested that there wasn’t much there so the report was quite short and also well written, so an easy way to end the day!——Matthew Williams is a Partner in L – P : Archaeology a UK based commercial archaeology (CRM) company. The Office Day by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"321","The Day of Archaeology seems to have unintentionally have been a day spent in ecclesiastical settings for me. It started with a visit to St Michaels and All Angels Church in Sutton near Peterborough for the Cambridgeshire Conservation Officer Forum meeting. This gathering happens every three months or so and allows Conservation Officers across the region to share best practice. It is hosted by a different authority each time, and this time it was our turn! Sutton Church was chosen as it has recently had works to create a new meeting space and kitchen within the 12th century fabric.Douglas from SPAB giving his presentation in the evening.

Each meeting has a specialist building conservation presenter and for this meeting we had Peter Minter of Cambridge Brick and Tile Company (and Bulmer Brick & Tile), who brought some samples with him to show issues affecting tiles (make sure you ventilate your roofs, was the overarching message). Following this we visited Sacrewell Farm and Country Centre, just a mile up the road, to see their Grade II* listed Watermill, recently the recipient of a first round pass from the Heritage Lottery Fund.In the evening I was back to a church, this time St John the Baptist in Peterborough City Centre, for the celebration event for Peterborough Buildings in Need, a project I have been running for the last nine months. Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund this project has had a series of masterclasses and lectures on the theme of valuing the historic environment, alongside volunteer surveys of Peterborough City Centre Conservation Area. The website and end of project report and toolkit are here. The evening had some great talks, including from Douglas Kent from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings or SPAB (in the photo above), and some performance poets reading their poetry about the city (including a poem just for the project, on the front page of the website, and well worth a read!).Alice Kershaw, Heritage Regeneration OfficerOpportunity Peterborough and Peterborough City Council The From Bricks to the Baptist: A Day of Archaeology in Peterborough. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

So I’m really happy about the Archaeological Day 2012.

"324","A DAY IN THE LIFE  - 29 June 2012http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Q9D4dcYng1.  Today we are supposed to be depositing a bunch of site archives with LAARC and need to put the finishing touches to a few of them to get them ready.  We have to check the microfilming, make sure all the digital records are in the right format, compile bibliographies and metadata, prepare deeds of transfer and get them signed and complete the special checklists required by LAARC.  There are 26 sites in all so better get on with it!!!!!!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fc67yQsPqQ2.  Part of the process is to prepare a pdf/A version of the site reports (including desk top assessments and project designs).  For older sites we have to convert the original Corel Draw report figures into pdf/A images and then combine them with the text to make the finished report.  The conversion process can be a bit slow, especially when your original figure is on the large size so finding other things to do whilst waiting for something to happen is always a good idea.  I chose to eat lunch ……http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nA18g_PwG0 3.  It’s the afternoon now and we are rapidly approaching 4 o’clock when we are due to take the boxes downstairs (at least we haven’t got far to go!).  Still got a bit to do so better get a move on.  The temperature in the office today hasn’t quite reached the heady heights of 31.8 degrees that we had yesterday but at 29.2 degrees it’s still warming up in here.  Ideal for rushing round like lunatics!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-mU-YSk32I 4.  We did it!  Twenty-two sites have gone down and we’re going to finish off the last 4 on Monday morning and sneak those in too with all the finds (Thanks Andy!).A trolley-load of archives!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0odXnKhKBxQ In between all this activity we’ve been answering queries, helping our colleagues to find records and books, doing some OASIS training, responding to emails, chasing people again for things that we’ve been waiting for, testing new software, finishing off the last of the outstanding site summaries, and, of course, Steph’s been co-ordinating all your Day of Archaeology entries too.  Next week we’ll have to start looking at the next lot of records to get ready .  Here we go again!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpjILzv1P4The Karen Thomas: A Day in the Life of an Archivist – The Musical! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"325","Disclaimer: The thoughts, opinions, and outright genius, presented in this blog are solely the responsibility of the author and in no way represent any archaeology firm or company.  That should cover it.June 29, 2012 is this year’s Day of Archaeology.  I was supposed to be in the field but as I’m not this post is going to be slightly different.  Last year (Part 1 and Part 2) I was monitoring for another company and I was in a very different place.  What a difference a year can make.  On to my day.In most CRM (Cultural Resource Management) firms in the United States, well, the Great Basin anyway, there is a lot of time spent typing up site records.  We generate a mountain of paperwork when we record a site in the field.  Let’s break down a simple site.The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) used to have a minimum four page form for filling out site records in several intermountain states.  It’s called the IMACS form and it stands for “InterMountain Antiquities Computer System”.  Odd name for a form, I know.  It was designed to have codes for each entry that could be entered into a database (using an encoding form) with the intent that the information could be recalled more efficiently.  Side note: people here sometimes refer to a single form as an “IMAC” form.  That, as you can see, is incorrect.  The “S” stands for system and is not a pluralizer (what?) of IMAC.  Back on track.The form consisted of two pages of administrative and environmental data (i.e. Landform, location, sediments, vegetation, etc.) and then additional pages depending on the type of site you have.  There are two pages for prehistoric sites (Page 1 and Page 2) and two pages for historic sites (Page 1 and Page 2).  There are even more pages for things like rock art.  As you can see, I’ve mentioned all of this as being in the past.  The BLM came out with a new form, sort of, in October of last year.The new form is one page.  All the data you were expected to collect on the old forms now goes on one page and if you forgot something because you are new then, I guess, you weren’t trained properly.  I like having one page because it’s less paper and I know how to fill out a form but I wonder about the next generation of users that are unsure of what to put on the form.  Everyone records a site by themselves at least once and, unless the training was really good, which it usually isn’t, then something will get missed.What does this have to do with what I did today?  Well, I was typing up site forms from the field all day.  One site with few artifacts and over twenty features took me several hours.  I didn’t do any interpretation or research.  I simply typed up what was recorded and made the record digital.  This procedure is not unique to the company I currently work for by any means.  Most companies have armies of field techs typing up site records.  The process really slows the project down and is often the reason projects go over budget.Instead of manually digitizing site information in the field we should be collecting it in a digital form to begin with.  I don’t know how long it took archaeologists to trust those newfangled GPS devices back in the day but I’m sure it was longer than the rest of the scientific community.  The same is true for digital site recording.  I feel that we are behind the curve on this one and need to catch up.  I’m attempting to do just that one step at a time.  A few weeks ago I finally convinced a field supervisor to let me record at least my portion of the sites on my iPad.  Since I’m a Crew Chief that means I do the bulk of the writing.  We figured that when calculated at the rate for office work I probably saved about $3-4000 during one 8-day session.  If all the crew chiefs were doing what I did we would have saved $9-12,000.  If the entire crew were doing that we would have saved at least $20,000.  That’s for one session.  I don’t know what the budget for that project was but I’m guessing we could have cut it in half.There are naysayers out there that say tablets are too fragile and they are too expensive.  What if you drop it and break it?  What if you loose all of your data?  What if the battery dies?  Good questions, all.  And, they all have answers.First, what if you drop it and break it?  Assuming the other questions are answered satisfactorily you are out a tablet.  Well, there is insurance that would replace the tablet.  Also, with as much money as you are saving you could just about afford to buy new ones every time you went out.  What about losing data?  When I used my iPad to record sites I tethered it to my iPhone periodically and uploaded the data, securely and encrypted, to my DropBox account.  The data was encrypted so even if the DropBox account were hacked it would take a super computer to break the code.  What’s that you say?  You don’t have cell service in the middle of no where?  No problem.  Get a rugged external hard drive that lives in your backpack.  Seagate makes one that is 250GB, has its own battery, generates a WiFI signal, and can be transferred to and from using any tablet or smartphone.  As far as the battery goes, it’s generally not an issue.  The iPad battery will more than last through a work day of any length, and generally longer.  If it does die there are external battery backs of different types (here, here, and here) that will provide a few charges should you need them.So, what I did today was type up site records while fighting to stay alert and focused.  I also daydreamed about a day in the, hopefully, not to distant future, where we spend more time in the field than in the office.Thanks for reading and I’ll see you in the field.The As Yet, Untitled by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated,

"326","This year we are now in the fourth season of excavation at the Bishop’s Palace at Downhill, on the north coast of Northern Ireland. Many people will know this site from the iconic Mussenden Temple. Over the past three seasons, we have cleared out and uncovered many of the domestic buildings of the amazing building, showing us what life was like for some of those who worked in the big house. The Palace was built in the 1770s by the Earl Bishop, Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry.  During construction, the Earl Bishop was often on the continent and continually sent back instructions for alterations to the house.  This has created a convoluted house that has been considerably altered; now a team of archaeologists are now attempting to understand these structures and conserve them for the future.  The Palace and much of the demesne is owned by the National Trust and the whole excavation has been run by the NT archaeologist for Northern Ireland, Malachy Conway, and a team of dedicated volunteers (some professional archaeologists and some interested amateurs)This season we have been beset by bad weather and a small volunteer workforce.  Our aim this year is to prepare the West Yard for public access and to finish clearing the northern part of the East Yard.  I have spent a few weeks refilling the gas holder that we spent the past two seasons excavating, it’s approximately 7m wide and 3m deep.  On the Day of Archaeology, we were all digging in the East Yard, working on the entrance to an animal enclosure.  Across the area, there is a scatter of sherds of white ceramic, probably plates used by the RAF when they were stationed here.  This season has not yet provided any interesting finds; unlike previous seasons, which have revealed Roman statue fragments and a Bronze Age bowl.  Much of our excavation has been assisted by a digger and mini-dumper, moving spoil and masonry around the site.  We now have two weeks left to finish clearing the yard. As well as volunteering with the National Trust on the Downhill Project, I’m doing a part-time PhD in medieval archaeology.  My research is looking at 14th-Century manors in England, recreating the buildings through an analysis of the annual manorial accounts.  Many of these sites have been lost or drastically altered, so documents are one of the few ways of studying them.  I’m looking at the types of buildings that were on the manor, the choice of building materials and their maintenance.  So far, I have only looked at a small number of manors, but there are already patterns emerging of high status buildings being constructed from very different materials to the agricultural ones.On Day of Archaeology, I was translating accounts from the manor of Oldington in Worcestershire.  Once you get an understanding of medieval Latin, medieval accounts are not that hard to read – they follow standard formulae and have a limited vocabulary.  But they are quite fun to read, as they describe the daily life on the manor, often naming the people doing the work and describing what they are doing, you can create a vivid picture of the bustling manor and its inhabitants.  This is a really interesting research project and will create a new understanding of medieval manorial buildings and their construction and repair.The Digging at a Cliff Top Palace by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"327","Friday was a busy field day, so I didn’t have a chance to post about our field school at the Johnston site in Western Pennsylvania. My colleague Sarah Neusius and I are in the Anthropology Department of Indiana University of Pennsylvania. We are excavating a large Late PreContact period Native village dated to the 14th-15 th century A.D. We are about to start the last week of the six week field school. This is the 4th season we have worked at the site.Dr. Sarah Neusius and Students during site excavationThe site was occupied by people from the Monongahela Culture who lived in Southwestern Pennsylvania from the 13th to 17th  centuries A.D.  They are known for their circular villages, shell tempered pottery and post enclosed storage pits attached to circular houses.  The site was first discovered in the 1950s by Dr. Don Dragoo of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA.  He conducted excavations in advance of the construction of a dam on the Conemaugh River to protection Pittsburgh from flooding.  It was thought the site would be destroyed by floodwaters back up by the dam.     We began to look for the site in 2002 and discovered that it was buried by flood deposited sediment which has protected the site.  For example, deer and other animal bone is well preserved.  Deer bone is the most common type of animal bone found at the site.Excavation of well preserved deer jaw.Excavations have found  the large posts used to construct houses and  stockades like this one.Large stockade postmold at the Johnston site. Posts in the post enclosed pits have been found as well.After the excavation of a post enclosed pit, profiles of the posts are visible.     This reconstructed house shows how the postenclosed pit might have looked under its bark covering.Reconstructed Monongahela HouseThe A Day at the IUP Excavation of  the Johnston site by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"328","It’s a typical early summer day, here in the Pacific Northwest of the United States—cool, gray, and cloudy. We don’t get summer until after the Fourth of July, usually. I park my car and walk, coffee in hand, to what will be the new collections and curation building for the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. Right now it’s where we store our equipment, and where the joint Portland State University/Washington State University Public Archaeology Field School has its lab. Last summer, I was a student in that field school. This summer, I am a government contractor, doing archaeological survey work for the National Park Service on land recently acquired from the U.S. Army. It’s a short contract, only about three weeks, but it is a great time and a great opportunity.In May, 2012, the U.S. Army relinquished the East and South Barracks areas of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site to the U.S. National Park Service as part of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The army has had a presence here since the First U.S. Artillery Regiment arrived in May, 1849. Before the army’s arrival, starting around 1824, the site was an active Hudson Bay Company fur trading outpost. Before the Hudson Bay Company’s arrival, the area was an active, seasonal location for Native Americans to take advantage of the spring salmon runs up what is now the Columbia River. The site has yielded artifacts from all of these eras, creating a picture of an area that has been used by humans for many generations.The exciting thing is that very little archaeological work has been done in the East and South Barracks areas—ever.What is archaeological survey? It’s a quick look. Basically, we’re peeking at different spots to try to get a picture of what’s going on beneath the current ground horizon before routes for underground utilities are dug. The National Park Service plans to refurbish many of the remaining historical buildings, and will be putting the modern utilities underground in order to preserve the park’s historic environment.My fellow surveyors and I load up a truck with our equipment. Because the site is in an urban area, we gather and store our tools every night and bring them out every morning. Shovels, breaker bars, buckets, paperwork, bags, camera, scales—everything goes into the truck and is unloaded at today’s shovel test site.Shovel test? It’s a 50×50 cm square hole that we dig straight down in 10 cm deep, arbitrary increments. We work in two-person teams, taking turns digging and screening the sediments. This morning, I’m a screener.We’ve got three 50×50 units still open from yesterday. The unit I was on has a wood feature that may be a horizontal fence bar or a foundation beam. There are bits and pieces of charcoal scattered nearby. The digger decides it warrants a closer look.Archaeology is all about working with others. No one can know everything about everything–and field consultations are key.I head to another unit to see if there’s anything I can do. I screen; finding a piece of 19th-century, olive-colored glass. We’ve gone deep enough, so the unit is back-filled and I ferry the equipment up to the next shovel test site. I check back in with the progress of the unit where I started. It’s been decided to re-fill the unit. We line the unit with ground fabric so that it can be more easily opened up again. Gingerly, we re-fill the hole. There is still paperwork for that feature and for that unit, so I move on to open the next unit. I ferry all of the equipment needed to do that and get to work. I really am getting more muscular.This unit is in an area that has had at least four different structures on or near it going back to at least 1874. I wrestle off the sod, dig down to 10 cm, and screen. Hurrah! There is a mix of artifacts including a square nail, a wire nail, clear glass, olive glass, and a tiny sherd of ceramic. These are a jumble of 19th and 20th century artifacts. This makes me think that this is a site that’s seen a lot of activity. Is the soil disturbed or is it fill? I trowel down to 20 cm and find more of the same.At a nearby unit, another team finds a couple of primer coilsLunchtime!After lunch, I’m part of a two-person team again. I trowel down to 30 cm and find a .22 cartridge and another cut nail. They were hiding under a rock. We get a visitor.One of the best things about working in an urban area are the visitors. It can be distracting, but people have great stories about their experiences with the site. It’s a connection and a reminder that the past isn’t some distant country, but a place that is as close as a conversation.After he leaves, I start on level four. As I loosen up the soil, a metal garter clip floats to the top.I am still amazed at how I can see the damndest—and smallest—things. My eyes get set to “artifact” and things that are too shiny, too regular, too straight, or a weird color, seem to stand out. I can’t explain it, but am glad it’s a skill I’m developing.Our fearless leader returns with the truck. I quickly finish the level, cover the unit with a piece of plywood and a safety cone, and carry things back to the truck.Back at the collections/curation/field school building, we organize our paperwork and artifacts. I ask for a picture with everyone on the crew.L to R: Bob, Eric, Jackie, Liz, and Leslie Another great day of archaeology ends with smiles and laughter.  The Fort Vancouver National Historic Site; Breaking New Ground by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"329","I spent much of the Day of Archaeology in closed windowless rooms discussing more or less weighty matters with other librarians.  Mercifully we manage to make some progress on some pressing issues.In between such things I have been thinking about the effect that open access publishing has on disciplines like archaeology and ancient near Eastern Studies and Classics and Mediterranean Archaeology. The master List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies I’ve been compiling since 2009  on The Ancient World Online now includes includes 1188 titles, and has increased by 238 titles in the past year.  That’s a big corpus.  All three of the institutions I’ve been affiliated with over the past three decades have made major commitments to open access publishing:  the Oriental Institute, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World.Are scholars reading and citing open access journals?  Are scholars seeking out open access publication venues?  Are scholars taking advantage of  the emerging idea of data journals?  Is it significant that more than 4500 souls have subscribed to the Ancient World Online daily email update?  Is it significant that most open access publications never makes it into library discovery tools?  What will be the effect of this summer’s  enormously successful Linked Ancient World Data Institute be by the time the second one rolls around in a year?  Are people using the Ancient World Linked Data JavaScript Library?It’s now two hot days later and these and other questions are still knocking around my mind. The Thinking About Open Access Archaeological Publishing by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"331","This year marks the first season of excavation on Rathnadrinna Fort, funded by the Royal Irish Academy of Ireland. Rathnadrinna Fort is a trivallate, circular hilltop enclosure situated in Lalor’s-Lot townland, 3.33km south-southeast of the Rock of Cashel, Co. Tipperary, Ireland.  The hilltop affords the fort extensive views across the adjacent low lying land and is inter-visible with a number of high-status forts surrounding the Rock of Cashel, to the north. Rathnadrinna Fort is the largest and best preserved of Cashel’s forts, and research here presents an ideal opportunity to learn more about the evolution and function of such sites in a royal landscape.After three weeks digging we have uncovered a stone-lined corn-drying kiln outside the fort, the excavation of the fort ditches is underway and these are proving to be substantial in nature. We have revealed the old ground surface beneath portions of the fort banks and the excavation of the fort interior is revealing many interesting features. Finds to date include worked flints, an unidentified ferrous object from the fill of the kiln, and an interesting assemblage of late post medieval finds from a dumping episode outside the fort bank.Our international team of volunteers includes diggers from Brazil, USA, Poland, Lithuania, Germany, Austria, England and Ireland. We have facilitated local primary school visits where the children were able be archaeologists for a day, meet the diggers and see our discoveries. For the Day of Archaeology Rowan Lacey gave a display of flint knapping, James Bonsall did a Magnetometer Survey over our kiln, Liudas Juodzbalys showed us a DVD of his experimental iron working, we had a game of hurling, the site director bought everyone a bag of the finest Morelli’s chips and Mickaela from San Paulo made a cheese fondue!

"332","Hello Everybody! I am very excited to take part again in the Day of Archaeology! I enjoyed taking part last year and afterwards reading the posts from all over the world.My name is Molly Swords and I am a historical archaeologist. I work for SWCA Environmental Consultants and teach the Applied Cultural Resource Management class at the University of Idaho. Currently, I have number of “irons in the fire” and multi-tasking is a necessity. As others have probably mentioned there are a number of days that you are not outside in the field. This happens to be one of those days.Phinney Hall houses the Sociology and Anthropology Department at the University of Idaho. I work mostly in the offices housed in this building.I start my day off with patronizing one of the many coffee stands around Moscow. I know what a busy day it is going to be… so, this is my little moment of Zen. A 24oz vanilla coffee is going to see me through the first part of the day.Upon arriving at work, I answer a number of different emails about various projects. The first email greeting me is a reply to an email I sent yesterday, including information that I gathered at the Washington State University Archives. I was able to venture over to WSU’s Special Collections and Archives to look over documents to help out some colleagues, Bob Weaver and Bruce Schneider, in another SWCA office. Part of the fascination of historical archaeology for me is getting to actually look through records to further explain the story.Another email I received was from a University of Idaho student that I taught last semester. She had a few questions about field school, as she would be attending her first one soon. I quickly replied to her… conveying a little of my jealousy that she would soon be out at the Rosebud Battlefield Field School.My desk at a relatively low level of chaos.Since I am teaching a class in the fall for the University of Idaho, a small part of my day is doing some administrative things in preparation for that class, including ensuring all my paperwork is in order to get my new identity card (as mine expires on July 1st) and that I’ve made an appointment to get trained on the technology equipment for the room that I will teach in. I contemplate thinking of which books to assign… and then decide that today is the day not to go down that rabbit hole. Though preparation for the class can be tedious, I love engaging archaeology students in discussions of real-world archaeology.I had a phone call with my SWCA PI (principal investigator), Jim Bard. We caught up on future opportunities and what is going on with the current project that we are working on Sandpoint, the main cultural resource project that I am involved with – a multi-year historical archaeology project in its final stages. I am compiling technical reports and editing versions coming back from the editors. With a collection of close to 600,000 artifacts this is no small feat.In between all of these things going on, I am working on a proposal. My SWCA supervisor Mini Sharma Ogle and I email about setting up a time to chat on Monday about the logistics of writing a project proposal and budget to monitor a construction area for cultural resources.Temporary housing and storage of the Sandpoint collection.It is around this time that I realize that I have not had lunch… the coffee has worked its magic until after 2pm. So, I grab a quick lunch with the Sandpoint Lab Director, Amanda Haught. It just so happens that this day is her last day as Lab Director. So, our lunch is a working lunch during which we discuss where things are and what needs to be finished. When we return from lunch, we sit down again and go over things… while I take many notes. I will be stepping in and overseeing the remainder of deaccessioning of collections and be available for the staff for any questions that may arise.It is around this time that Mark Warner makes his third appearance of the day in our office. Our cluster of offices are almost directly above his office so, it is a short commute for him to come visit. And as one of the PI’s of the Sandpoint Project, we see him at least once a day. Amanda and I quickly chat with him about progress of the collection and report.Home Rule Irish pipe recovered from archaeological excavations of Willa Herman’s turn-of-the-century bordello in Sandpoint.Coming home and decompressing on the porch, with a jack and coke, which led to drinks with my amazing neighbor, a National Park Service archivist, who is from Wisconsin and makes the best Old Fashions! She told me a popular joke among archivists, “Has Ken touched your collections?” (Ken Burns). Which made me laugh and laugh.As we sit in her backyard and catch up on our professions, I can’t help but think about all the amazing archaeologists that I’ve had the pleasure of working with on the Sandpoint Project and that I have the best job in the world!Whew… hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my whirlwind day.

"334","The Day of Archaeology 2012 started the way every other day this week did, in the lab.  Unlike the past seven summers, the Nuvuk Archaeology Project is spending a good bit of the summer in the lab.  We have been digging at a furious pace over those summers, because Nuvuk, site of a village occupied from Thule times through contact and up until the 20th century, the associated cemetery, and, it turns out, an Ipiutak occupation 500 km north of any previously known,is eroding at an average rate of 6 meters per year, up from an average of just over 3 meters per year around 1950.  All that digging has resulted in quite a mountain of artifacts and faunal material.  The individuals recovered from the burials are analyzed and reburied in the Barrow cemetery, but the other items remain.We don’t take a lot of weather days during the short summers, so lab work mostly happens on weekends during the school year.  The Nuvuk crew is mostly made up of local high school students, augmented by undergraduate and grad students in summer, and they have full school days and often sports commitments as well.  As a result, we haven’t been able to process (clean, mark, catalog) everything before the next field season begins.  I decided that we should use the remaining project funds to make sure that was done and done properly. Thus, lab work.Our crew was fairly small today.  One person who started the summer with us got a more or less permanent job, and another was offered 4 years of summer internships in the field she hopes to go into after college, and a  third just got married on Tuesday!Trace, Kyle and Coby hard at work in the lab, cataloging Nuvuk artifacts.Trace showing everyone a really nice whalebone pick head he is about to catalog.Victoria takes a turn at data entry. All those catalog sheets have to be entered into the existing catalog, created in the field when we record proveniences with the theodolite.We also have a volunteer working in the lab.  Becca Connor is an intern with the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium.  She’s also interested in socio-natural systems, particularly the possible effects of environmental change on subsistence.  She’s in the process of pulling samples of faunal material from a midden at Pingusugruk, a bit down the coast from Barrow, that was excavated with very good provenience data for faunal material.  I’ve picked a couple of units that seem to contain faunal material from the top of the midden to the bottom and don’t seem to have anything usual happening, and she’s going to ID that with my help and see if any changes are apparent.  The house the midden was associated with was abandoned & reoccupied, so we’re hopeful.Becca asking what to do with the Styrofoam peanuts that the bags of faunal material were packed in for shipping (it was excavated in the 1990s.)The morning passed with bags being opened, their information checked against the catalog, and the contents being sorted and cataloged.  We are using archival paper labels that we adhere with an Arcyloid solution, so that happens as another step to reduce the exposure to acetone fumes.  We do it under an extractor, so only 1-2 people can work on it, and it has to happen on the bench Becca is using.  I don’t allow materials from more than one site on a bench at a time.  Less chance of confusion that way.The afternoon was very different.  The final nalukataq (whaling feast) of the year was being held in Barrow, so we took the afternoon off so everyone could attend.  The 5 successful captains set up a windbreak on the nalukataq grounds, and anyone and everyone is welcome to come, get fed and take some home.  The way the Iñupiat see it, the captains & crews don’t catch the whales, the individual whales have chosen to give themselves to the individual captains, who are expected to take very good care of the whale and share as much as possible out of respect for the whale. Prayers of thanksgiving are said before every round of servings.It starts with soup (usually with bread & such) around noon, then mikiaq (fermented meat, blubber, blood & so forth) around 3 PM.  It’s very tasty when made right, and no odder than moldy lumps of curdled milk with veins of mold running through it, AKA a nice ripe Stilton.  Around 6PM there is quaq (frozen whale meat) and frozen muktuk (whale skin with some blubber attached, which is both delicious and incredibly warming on a cold day).  There is almost always a sort of dried fruit stew, apples & oranges, and if the captains and/or their wives have been able to arrange it, often special treats like frozen fish or akutaq (AKA Eskimo ice cream).I was a bit late because I got caught up in another issue, so I missed the first course, the goose soup.  I did get there in time for mikiaq, and got 2 rounds.  The first I had some of right there with the folks I was sitting with, and it was very tasty indeed.  Unfortunately, I forgot my camera & had to use my phone, so the pictures aren’t the best.Tails and flippers set out at nalukataq for visitors to help themselves. Flags of some of the whaling captains who are hosting this nalukataq fly above the windbreak in the background.The blanket is at the left, with kids on it between servings. Adults don’t go on it until the evening.One thing I love about Nalukataqs is that there are always some little kids in pretty parkas playing in the sand & gravel between servings.  They just get into their own little worlds there amid all the people.Little girl playing in the sand.Girl playing in the gravel next to the blanket, which is on the ground at the moment.With five crews hosting (and therefore 5 whales to share), there was a mountain of meat and muktuk.  Crews bring it from the ice cellars just before it is served.  Most of them brought in trucks, and one crew actually got a front end loader and stacked the boxes of whale in the bucket to bring them over.Meat and muktuk being brought from the ice cellars.Then it was shared with everyone…  There were people from other villages, at least as far away as the Kotzebue region, and people who live in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and they will take their whale home and share it even farther.That isn’t all of the whale.  Similar amounts will be shared by these captains at the Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, they will share on special occasions.  Of course, crew members and those who helped tow and butcher the whale already got shares when the whale was taken, and they will be sharing that throughout the year too.Going to Nalukataq may not sound like archaeology, but whaling has been the organizing focus of this culture since before most of the sites I work on were formed.  I really don’t see how one can expect to interpret these sites without a pretty good understanding of what whaling actually entails.The A Day of Archaeology at the Top of the World by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"335","Last year, several of my colleagues participated in the Day of Archaeology 2011 (Marks and Swords). I am excited and honored to contribute to this year’s posts. Today, I worked hard to keep up with my various and evolving roles as archaeologist, student, and assistant curator. As a research assistant and graduate student in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Idaho, I carry out a variety of tasks for a large historic archaeology project from Sandpoint, Idaho, a cultural resource project I began working on as an technician five years ago (holy cow!) with the companies CH2MHill and SWCA Environmental Consultants. Simultaneously, I am in the throes of thesis research and act as a museum assistant and curator for the Appaloosa Museum and Heritage Center in Moscow, Idaho.Dakota Smith, a.k.a. Smitty, is a classic example of an Appaloosa horse and will reside in the pasture adjacent to the museum for the summer.This morning I awake early to tend to Smitty, the Appaloosa horse-in-residence, main feature of the Appaloosa Museum’s live exhibit, and, I’m guessing, a somewhat unusual curation circumstance for a traditional museum. Then, switching gears, I drive to the University of Idaho to put in a few hours of deaccessioning artifacts from the Sandpoint Archaeology Project collection, the largest historical archaeological collection in the state of Idaho. Myself and several other students from the University of Idaho sort through boxes (… and boxes… and boxes…) of artifacts and execute the deaccessioning procedures carefully planned by the project’s principal investigators.Deaccessioning is a process of officially (and usually permanently) removing items from a collection, museum, or repository, a practical curation necessity in the case of the extensive Sandpoint collection. Deaccessioned artifacts will find new homes in such educational resources as historical artifact comparative collections and teaching kits. For my master’s thesis I am collaboratively developing and evaluating historical archaeology teaching kits and lesson plans based on historical research and Sandpoint project findings. The deaccessioned historical artifacts will add an experiential element to the kits and provide materials for students to analyze.Archival safe labels, bags, and boxes are used for storing artifacts.It’s not yet ten o’clock in the morning and I must return to the Appaloosa Museum for the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon. Though archaeological materials are not part of the museum’s collections, many of my curatorial tasks are similar to those performed at the archaeological repository for northern Idaho, the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology. As a new employee at a small museum I will learn a variety of often-specialized jobs such as collections management, exhibit design and maintenance, and give museum tours. Today’s tasks mostly include accessioning paperwork, data entry, updating website and social media information, greeting visitors, and answering questions. These tasks are all typical of museum work and many of the principles and processes are similar to those utilized in museums and repositories curating archaeological collections.One aspect that is not so similar to archaeological work is the arrival of the second Appaloosa in residence for the summer, Snickers. Her arrival broke up my day and made Smitty very happy. As I write this, I begin to wonder if technically the horses should be formally documented as loans to the museum… though the horses’ owners belong to the Appaloosa Horse Club, which owns the pasture behind the museum…Snickers and Smitty settle in to grazing.At the end of the (official) work day I head home to develop lesson plans for the archaeology teaching kits and begin to draft a syllabus for the teacher in-service I am planning for this fall. The syllabus is a requirement of the in-service proposal I must submit to the University of Idaho and, if all goes well, teachers will be able to earn a continuing education credit while learning about archaeology and the use of the historical archaeology teaching kits (to be modeled after the well-executed in-service offered by Project Archaeology through Montana State University). After several hours our awesome neighbors invite us over to listen to some live banjo music and I take a much-needed break.This poison bottle, one of many recovered from Sandpoint’s restricted district, is an example of a type of artifact that will be utilized in teaching collections.Well past midnight and much later than intended, I begin updating the projects page for the Idaho Archaeological Society’s (IAS) website. Next comes this post and finally, before I nod off to sleep, I will pick up where I left off last night by reading about Basque history in preparation for the upcoming IAS archaeology project, archaeological investigations at the Cyrus Jacobs/Uberuaga House. Members of the society will be excavating the well associated with the house next to the Basque Museum and Cultural Center in downtown Boise, Idaho. A perfect opportunity for publicly interpreting archaeological excavations!If all goes well, this year will culminate in the completion of the large long-term archaeology project as well as my completion of the master’s program. As an archaeologist interested in public education and engagement, I am continually thankful to work with folks who are supportive of my teaching kit project and are enthusiastic about public education and involvement in historical archaeology.University of IdahoFurther Reading: Sandpoint Archaeology ProjectExcavated by cultural resource archaeologists between 2005-2008 prior to the construction of a byway, Sandpoint’s earliest historic district originally abutted newly-built tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad and ancient shores of Lake Pend d’Oreille before the town expanded across Sand Creek. In the thousands of years prior to the influx of railroad, lumber, and mining industries in northern Idaho at the turn of the century, tribes such as the Kallispel and Kootenai seasonally inhabited the shores of Lake Pend d’Oreille and crisscrossed the region in a transhumance cycle. (Transhumance is a seasonal cycle of moving between traditional lands.)Though Native Americans traversed the region for thousands of years before settlers, due to the explosion of material production following the American industrial revolution and Sandpoint’s location along the railroad the majority of recovered artifacts date to the occupation of Sandpoint’s historic commercial and restricted districts – including a hotel, pharmacy, jeweler, butcher, dance hall, brothel, bordello, and saloons – along with the Humbird Lumber Mill’s technologically transitional blacksmith and machine shop, a Chinese residence and laundry, and one of the town’s first jail. Analysis of these materials in conjunction with historical research will allow archaeologists to shed light on some of the lesser-known lives of townsfolk as well as add details to the history of the town’s development and role in the beginnings of a globalizing world.As you may have already learned from reading other great posts, the life of archaeology extends far beyond initial research or field excavations. Since archaeologists finished excavations four years ago we have catalogued the artifacts, presented initial findings at professional conferences and public lectures, are finishing up the cultural resource report for the Idaho Transportation Department, developing content for the project web page, preparing the collection for curation, anticipating the project exhibit at the Bonner County Historical Museum planned for the end of the year and have completed a variety of other tasks, some of which are being discussed by my colleagues. We are only scratching the surface and are excited for many years of analyses yet to come.This sign was recovered during Humbird blacksmith/machine shop excavations in 2008.The Archaeology and Appaloosas by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"336","AntequenEl día de la arqueología #dayofarch ha sido el menos arqueológico de los de esta semana ya que no sólo de estratos vive el hombre lo que no quita que este día haya podído interactuar con una multitud de arqueólogos vía la estupenda herramienta que es el pajarrako_azul (Twitter).Santa Helena, Patrona de los arqueólogosEn el antequen del día de la arqueología comentabamos, en el twiterio, ante la aleatoriedad de la fecha que lo suyo hubiera sido haber escogido el Patrón o la Patrona de los arqueólogos “santificados” por distintas Iglesias, pero claro es un evento aconfesional y me huele a mi que en el mismo hay bastante gente Animista. El hecho es que surge un primer nombre y fecha que no es fruto de la aleatoriedad, Santa Helena (Flavia Julia Augusta Helena)/18 de Agosto. Patrona de los arqueólogos, matrimonios dificiles, divorciados, “conversos” y LooL emperatrices. Bueno pues esta Santa Señora, que no lo dudo, es algo así como una de las primeras arqueológas con Método moderno. El caso es que al ser la madre de Constantino financio con el erario del pueblo de Roma  (subvención pública) la busqueda de la verdadera Cruz de Cristo, Vera Cruz, así que se encamino hacía la periferia del Imperio ha hacer consulta de campo,  la verdad es que no había pasado muchos años desde la muerte de Jesús, la iluminación le viene en el 326 dc a orillas del Bosforo. De sus peripecias arqueológicas nos han quedado los relatos de Crisóstomo, Ambrosio, Paulino de Nola y Sulpicio Severo. Según estos no le debio ir muy bien a la hora de practicar la “entrevista arqueológíca” a los cristianos, no le supierón dar orientación ninguna. Así que comienza a indagar en los estamentos Judios, dando por fin con un tal Judas, LooL, que le mete el camelo de que una facción de Judios, de aquellos que salían en la Vida de Bryan, habían escondido y enterrado (fraude arqueológico) en un pozo  la tan anhelada por ella verdadera cruz.  La localización exacta estaba en el Monte del Calvario, como no podía ser de otra forma, lo malo es que encima había un templo dedicado a Venus, ni corta ni perezosa lo manda derribar para dar con el pozo.Iglesia de la Vera Cruz (Segovia)Tras un tiempo realizando sondeos y excavaciones abiertas para satisfacción y jubilo de Helena encuentran las tres cruces, pero date ahora hay que deducir cual es la que pertenecia a Jesucristo, por morfometría, la más grande, la más pequeña, la mediana, pues no por intercesión divina, un miembro del equipo, el obispo Demetrio, tuvo la genial idea de colocar una enferma moribunda cristiana sobre las tres cruces por si alguna de ellas se manifestaba como la Vera Cruz. Probarón en una, fail, probaron en la segunda, fail, ya probarón en la última y Milagro. La moribunda cristiana se recupero de todos sus males. Para celebrar tan glorioso día mando eregir un Templo que no fue Museo por que se encargo de hacer astillas de la cruz en tres partes y mandar una a Constantinopla, otra quedó en Jerusalén y una  tercera  a Roma donde hoy es venerada en la iglesia de la Santa Cruz de Jerusalén. (saqueo de bienes culturales). En el santoral existen dos santos más considerados como patrones de la arqueología, pero mola la Helena con H.#dayofarchLo de arkeo_heavymetal viene dado porque en los años que estudiaba y practicaba estas cosas de desenterrar huesos y alguna que otra piedra surgio la critica “Radical”, a las maneras de representación de las realidades pasadas de la arqueología procesualista, pues ya que había tantas formas de comprender/representar que no explicar las sociedades pasadas, unido a la concrección de un “Yo” débil en cada arqueólogo pues mi cosmovisión y acercamiento a la historia de esos pueblos sin historia debería ser heavy metalera, y vaya si lo era. Al día de hoy, #dayofarch, despues de tener abandonada la arqueología durante un cierto tiempo en diferentes etapas intento hacer una tesis doctoral sobre Datos abiertos, reutilización de los mismos y creación de bases de conocimiento a través de los estándares de la Web Semántica es una consecuencia lógica después de haber estado urgando durante un cierto tiempo en la interoperabilidad sintáctica a través de los estándares de los servicios web geográficos, la verdad es que llevo muchos años jugando con los mapitas, la arkegeomática me mola más que una gominola, ahora solo falta darle una capita de interoperabilidad semántica que de hecho ya la tiene en recursos como geonames.Más en el ámbito de lo concreto me he unido a un grupo entusiasta para llevar a cabo un proyecto de Arqueología  Comunitaria/Pública  para divulgar e involucrar a la gente del “territorio” en el conocimiento de su pasado histórico en la Edad del Hierro II, en estos momentos estoy construyendo la Web del proyecto con el mayor número de herramientas colaborativas posibles, de mapeado, de generación de bibliografías, etc. que aunque medio terminada pondremos online en Agosto que es cuando haremos el trabajo de campo para desbrozar un poco los Castros y hacer una documentación de los mismos para crear recursos de Realidad Aumentada utilizando KML, o sea, sin comerse el coco, O_oPostquenAunque en periodo vacacional, casi realmente estoy en un estado de Permanent Vacation, hoy me he atado la pata a la silla para escrbir este post.  Interesante iniciativa que tiene visos a consolidarse en un futuro próximo.

"337","*This is a summary of our post in Spanish for non-Spanish readersWhen we decided to join Day of Archaeology, we felt we needed to do something special. AMTTA was born in 2007 to try dignify our sector, so we spended four years drafting a labour agreement for Madrid… that adventure failed (at least as we programmed it), so we put a larger effort in our outreach activities and other objectives.Among them, our star project for the coming years was ‘Combates por la Historia‘ (Combats for History). We aimed to create and promote different routes in order to value and socialuze hidden, forgotten and destroyed heritage in Madrid. The first of the routes is ‘Campus de Batalla’ (Battle Campus) about the remains of the fights in Ciudad Universitaria during the Spanish Civil War. We used the information of the research conducted in 2008 [see blog of the team]. The only remaining memory of the conflict is the one represented by the fascist monuments in Moncloa and the Campus. Nobody wanted to recover the memory of the conflict itself, so we decided to use the materials available (as some of our members take part in the research group) and do it ourselves as a starting point for our project.This is what we presented the 29th, the project and the route, with a guided tour to the 7 points we chose and the placement of several posters with info of each point.En el punto 4EN EL ARCO DE LA VICTORIA[You can follow the route in images here]In the afternoon, we participated in a round table about heritage and the crisis, organized by a platform we joined this month, Madrid Ciudadanía y Patrimonio, showing our worry about the moral and economic crisis that is affecting archaeology after the ‘building boom’ of the 90s and 20s. In this context, we wanted to introduce a debate about a new law that the regional government of Madrid is planning, which lives the door open to the destruction of cultural (especially archaeological) heritage [see news in Spanish]. Once again heritage is the victim of negligent politicians.[see photos of the event here - by MCyP] Anyway, you can follow us at:amtta.blogspot.comfacebook.com/AMTTA.Arqueologia@AMTTArqSee you next year! The AMTTA’s #DayofArch (A Short English version) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"338","Desde la Asociación Madrileña de Trabajadores y Trabajadoras en Arqueología (AMTTA) hemos decidido inaugurar el proyecto “Combates por la Historia” el 29 de junio con motivo del Día de la Arqueología. Se trata de una serie de rutas arqueológicas por Madrid organizadas por periodos históricos (paleolítico, medieval islámico, contemporáneo, etc.) para que la sociedad pueda conocer los restos que han sido excavados en su calle, en su barrio, en su municipio, y que nunca se han publicado ni señalizado. En la mayoría de los casos permanecen enterrados o ya han sido por completo “destruidos científicamente”. Para rescatar la memoria de estos yacimientos ocultos hemos generado una serie de carteles explicativos que se irán colocando en los diferentes puntos de cada ruta [ver blog].Nuestra primera ruta la llamamos “Campus de Batalla”, y tiene por objeto dar a conocer los restos de la Guerra Civil que se conservan en el campus de la Universidad Complutense. En el 2008 se realizó una campaña de prospección, excavación, documentación de impactos en las fachadas de los edificios históricos del campus, investigación en archivos y entrevistas a combatientes para rescatar la información histórica sobre aquel periodo, pero sobre todo por el valor patrimonial de aquellos restos [ver blog]. Por un claro déficit democrático que aún se vive en nuestro país ninguna administración pública, incluida la Universidad, ha querido musealizar y poner en valor dichos restos, pese a todo el trabajo de documentación arqueológica e histórica realizada. La única memoria histórica que aún sigue vigente en el campus es la de los monumentos fascistas que se construyeron tras la Guerra Civil en honor de los combatientes muertes del bando franquista. El mejor símbolo material de la memoria histórica franquista es el Arco de Triunfo que preside la entrada al campus. Por ello desde AMTTA hemos decidido comenzar nuestros “Combates por la Historia” por la arqueología de la Guerra Civil española, porque creemos que es muy urgente y necesaria una relectura democrática de toda esta materialidad contemporánea, así como una exhumación oficial de las decenas de miles de personas represaliadas que aún permanecen en fosas comunes.Presentación histórica en el punto 1Pegando un cartel en el punto 2           Más explicaciones en el punto 2En el punto 4El punto 7 en MoncloaEN EL ARCO DE LA VICTORIA[Puedes seguir la ruta aquí]Ya por la tarde AMTTA participó en una mesa redonda abierta al público en el Ateneo de Madrid, junto a otras asociaciones en defensa del patrimonio, englobadas todas ellas en “Madrid Ciudadanía y Patrimonio” [ver web]. El tema del debate fue “Patrimonio y Crisis” y allí se abordaron las diferentes preocupaciones de los colectivos por los efectos que puede tener el patrimonio cultural e histórico, ya de por sí severamente castigado por las últimas décadas de especulación urbanística y boom inmobiliario. Una buena parte del debate se centró en las futuras reformas legislativas en la Comunidad de Madrid [ver ley con las alegaciones de AMTTA] cuyo fin es desproteger aún más el patrimonio histórico con el objetivo de facilitar la construcción y la depredación capitalista, hoy en horas bajas como consecuencia de la crisis económica que ellos mismos han generado [ver noticia]. De nuevo, el patrimonio histórico y el medio ambiente vuelven a ser las principales victimas de un modelo económico obsoleto y perjudicial.During the round table[Podéis ver más fotos aquí, por cortesía de MCyP]Al final, un día ajetreado en el que tuvimos la oportunidad de celebrar un día como este y gracias a #DayofArch, la de compartirlo con todos vosotros.Podéis encontrarnos en:amtta.blogspot.comfacebook.com/AMTTA.Arqueologia@twitter[Los contactos y el resto de recursos, están ahí] The Difundiendo el Patrimonio Madrileño by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"339","As a college student, the question of my major and future career ambition is one of those frequently asked questions that I contend with on a daily basis. Very few seemingly understand what it means to study cultural anthropology- that isn’t necessarily a value judgement, merely an assessment of my personal experiences. The FAQ takes various forms, but amounts to something like “What are you going to do with that?” or “Oh, so you’re going to be a teacher.”One of the many docks that is part of the inventory of Sleeping Bear Dunes National LakeshoreI must admit that I often ask myself the same question(s), which prompted me to participate in an internship rather than a field school this summer as part of my undergraduate degree requirements. I knew that I had to find something that interested me both as an anthropologist and as a historian.I ended up working on a project that satisfies both of those requirements. So far this summer, I have participated in a NAS fieldschool that was held in Traverse City, Michigan and helped other underwater archaeology students with their individual projects. I have attended various organizational events as a representative of my site supervisor/mentor. But for me, one of the coolest things about this internship is my participation in a complete inventory of the historic docks and piers of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.Last summer at this time, I was spending the day conducting research on a shipwreck that washed ashore in the same area in late 2010. This summer, I spent the day (once again) doing research. And while the area of historic research is not really in my scope of interest, the information that I found on one of the historic sites is rather fascinating (which for me was rather unexpected). The dock that I am researching is called Aral Dock and is one of many century old docks in the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore that has all but disintegrated into just pilings. The dock itself was rather homogeneous for the area in both build and use. Cargo such as lumber and agricultural items was loaded and unloaded at the dock and was sent on its way to various ports around the Great Lakes. Aral Dock is not interesting (for me) because of it’s construction, or materials, or rate of decay; Aral dock is interesting because of the scandal that surrounds it.Research through local and regional newspapers as well as oral history from residents shows that there was a double homicide on this particular dock, earning it the nickname “Murder Dock”. The reason was money related- taxes, specifically- and the murder touched the small agricultural port town in a way that was unexpected for that community.  As a student of anthropology and history, this salacious history of an area that is currently considered to be quiet and relaxing for residents and tourists alike is an interesting study in local anthropology.The area itself was a combination of industrial and agricultural, with the docks acting as a material reminder of how these people once lived and worked. What remains of the historic docks in the area is submerged in varying depths of water, ranging from shoreline depths to fifteen feet. Position fixing has been a chore, especially because of the wave action that is common in this specific bay on Lake Michigan. That is not to say that this experience hasn’t been enlightening or enjoyable. I can now say with confidence that I know what it is that I can do with my degree in Anthropology: I want to take what I have learned and apply it the field of historic archaeology, specifically sites that are underwater. Yes, I will likely spend more time in a library, museum, or historical society than I will in the field. I will likely be spending large amounts of time sifting through innumerable amounts of historic photos and oral histories as I did on the Day of Archaeology. But I have come to realize that there is no better way for me to combine my interests in history and human culture than by studying the physical material remains of the people that once occupied the most beautiful place in America.Plus, my office will have one heck of a view. So, there’s that, too. The Archaeology is Anthropology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"340","Day of Archaeology 2012 falls in the middle of the University of West Florida’s (UWF) 10 week long field school season. The university offers four archaeological field schools—three terrestrial (Campus Survey, Colonial Frontiers, and Arcadia Mill) and one maritime—and I am fortunate to serve as a supervisor at Campus Survey. Under the direction of Dr. Ramie Gougeon and graduate student supervisors, university students transform classroom knowledge into real world experience. Campus Survey teaches students about archaeological methods and techniques related specifically to cultural resource management (CRM). Students learn how to use a compass, read maps, and develop other field techniques while also sharpening their digging skills. After completing the survey portion of the field school, students also excavate a prehistoric site—named Thompson’s Landing– on UWF’s campus.Campus Survey begins with students learning about archaeological survey techniques by digging countless shovel tests.To begin this summer, we surveyed a portion of campus near Thompson’s Landing. Campus growth and general improvements may place a road within the survey area. As the students learned how to dig shovel tests, take notes, complete paperwork, and successfully navigate the woods, they also encountered what most people consider the most interesting part of archaeology—the artifacts!Within the first three weeks, the students discovered and defined the boundaries of four separate lithic scatters. Two shovel tests revealed interesting features—one of shell and the other a burnt pit—that led to the first units of the summer. Unfortunately, the shells appeared modern and the other feature is likely a burnt tree. Despite these faux features, the survey portion provided great information about larger research questions relating to Pensacola’s prehistory. The lithic scatters suggest information about prehistoric peoples’ behaviors and activities while also providing information about site formation processes.A completed shovel test– proof that a round shovel can dig a square hole 1 meter deep!Research questions and excavations at Thompson’s Landing, however, focus more specifically on shells and ceramics. Last year, field school students unearthed a substantial shell midden with complicated, ill-defined chronology. This year we hoped to identify discrete shell deposits to better outline periods of use, to understand subsistence patterns, and to improve our knowledge of ceramic differentiation through time within the region. With the aid of auger test results, the completion of five units, and the use of student manpower, the site began to provide answers.We exposed the shell midden in its entirety before bisecting it and excavating in levels.Of these five units (three of which included shell midden), one proved essential to answering some of our questions with ease. The shells present included rangia and polymesoda, two different types of clams. Between the two, rangia usually serves as the dominant species, yet the midden primarily yielded polymesoda shells. The dietary shift caused new questions to arise: Did food preferences change? Did environmental factors affect the shells availability? Perhaps changes in salinity or water temperature affected the shells and enabled polymesoda to dominate?Volunteer, Lianne Bennett, sits next to the exposed shell midden.As we contemplated the significance of the shells, ceramic sherds began to appear in the midden. The sherds recovered were shell-tempered, consistently dating the midden to the Mississippian period. Despite modern trash, such as glass and iron fragments, resting a few centimeters above the shell midden, no modern artifacts appeared within the feature. The first half of field school enabled students to learn, provided a feature comprised of an intact artifactual assemblage, and the beginning of a fantastic answer to one of our research questions!The material culture associated with the shell midden– from one level of one half of the unit from one day.A shell tempered sherd with the incised and punctated decorations suggesting a Moundville Incised variety Bottlecreek. The small handle likely enabled people to hang the vessels while preparing the food.Shell-tempered ceramic sherds recovered from the shell midden consistently date the midden to the Mississippian period. The sherds pictured above are identified as Moundville Incised variety Bottlecreek.The archaeological process often follows a pattern in which the discovery of new information leads to new questions. I hope the next year fuses the information we have (or have unearthed) with the data and knowledge that archaeology helps to uncover.

"341","Hello!Excited with my find… no, really.Last year’s Day Of Archaeology saw me on a rather disappointing, but entirely typical urban project in York.  This year sees me on the other side of the Atlantic embarking on an entirely new venture.  In fact, the Day of Archaeology coincides (almost) with my first ever day working in commercial archaeology in Alberta in western Canada, and I’m both excited and nervous.  My Friday was taken up with a rather uneventful first aid course so I have taken the liberty of documenting Monday, which was my first day, and was much more interesting.My day begins at 8am when I’m picked up from a friend’s place in Edmonton by Marg, who runs Circle Consulting.  We travel out to Stony Plain, where we meet Stephanie, an environmental consultant, who is accompanying us on our archaeological survey.  A further half hour drive takes us to the first of the mile long segments along the route of a water pipe that is to be surveyed.Tailgate talk (done on the bonnet, but nevermind)The first job is to do various health & safety paperwork; a standard risk-assessment, but here called a tailgate talk… or something.  Then we tool up.  I have been in archaeology a while, but I lack a lot of the PPE that is necessary here,  (thanks Marg for the loan).  It includes the boots, gloves, eye-protection, and sturdy long-sleeved clothes that I’m used to, as well as a sturdy red vest/equipment harness,  2litres of water, insect repellent (not enough as it turns out), hat (protection from the sun and ticks), gaiters (swampy ground and ticks again), bear horn & bear spray (funnily enough for bears), that I’m definitely not used to, as well as a lightweight spade. An easy start to the job.We set off on the first of the survey transects.  This part of Canada was originally surveyed in mile by mile “sections”, each divided into 4 “quarter sections” measuring half a mile square, and encompassing 160 acres.  Most of our survey transects were a mile long, and therefore a two mile round trip back to the truck.  This sounds easy, but as I was to discover, the terrain was extremely variable, and often very difficult.   Shovel testingIn places along the route that have a higher potential for human occupation, such as near watercourses, on south-facing slopes etc. we dig occasional shovel test-pits, each circa 30cm by 30cm, and only as deep as the sterile natural geology, and examine the upcast for artefacts.  The positions are marked with a hand-held GPS, notes are taken about the deposit depths and make-up, and if no artefacts have turned up we move on. On the second transect I find a bifacial tool fragment, which was the only stone of any sort in all of the shovel test pits I dug.  I find it hard to guage how common or uncommon this sort of find is during survey work, but I get the impression that it is towards the uncommon end of the scale. This is the shovel test pit, so it really seems like needle-in-haystack stuff.  If an artefact is found in a test-pit, the next step is to dig a pattern of further test pits around the find-spot to determine if it is part of a larger scatter of artefacts and if so, how far it extends.  Video here.Sadly, we don’t find anything in these test-pits, which I assume means that the bifacial tool was discarded or lost, and is not part of a occupation site.  Video here.After our second mile long transect, 4 miles hiked so far, we have a welcome lunch in the truck. Video here. And we plan our next phase of work. Video here.The third transect turns out to be where a road was started, the ditches were dug and the ground built up, but no surface was laid.  This therefore, is disturbed ground where there is little to no chance of finding an occupation site. This bit was not going to be productive, however the wildlife more than made up for it. Video here.This transect was a long one, so we moved a vehicle to the far end so that we needn’t hike it twice.  Here is a video of the different type of terrain.  On this one we quite often lost the marked route of the pipeline. Video here.At the end of the day we try to find a historic house that the pipeline passes.  We weren’t successful on this occasion, but here is a pic from the next day when we did find it.  It was built in the 1920′s by a skilled stonemason who used local stone (glacial erratic boulders I think), and is entirely unlike the other historic buildings out here.  I like it, but it looks a bit modern to my UK biased eyes.     I’ve had a great day, but I have no idea if it is typical of the work I’m going to be doing over the next 4 or 5 months.  Six miles, 33 shovel test-pits, some strange finds, left, and (video here), lots of insect bites, but no tick or bear encounters thankfully, and I’m knackered but pleased.  That’s my day, thanks for joining me on it!      The A Day of Archaeological Survey in Alberta’s Parkland by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"342","A day late – but I was under particular time consraint both today and yesterday. My university requires every current PhD student to submit a “substantial piece of written work” by the end of today, and I can now say – it’s done! I submitted a chapter on the spatial analysis of artefacts relating to high-status industries found within the Main City North, a suburb of the ancient Egyptian city of Amarna. Using the awesome open source GIS package Quantum GIS have been able to establish where in this suburb industrial activity took place, where new, unknown working areas may be located, and, to a certain extent, how raw materials as well as finished goods have been distributed. My research aims and objectives can be found on my website.The distribution of metal artefacts in the Main City NorthThe site, which is located in Middle Egypt, is currently being excavated by Barry Kemp and the Amarna Trust, this has been the case since the 1970s, but it has been subject to excavations since the 1890s, when Petrie undertook work at Amarna.   I was extremely lucky to participate in the Spring 2012 excavation season at Amarna. A preliminary report, written by Barry Kemp can be found here, and I have also published my own photos on Picasa.The house of Pawah at AmarnaThe famous bust of Nefertiti was discovered on December 6th 1911 by Ludwig Borchardt and his team within the house of the sculptor Thutmose (within the Main City North) and was subsequently brought to Berlin, which is why the 100th anniversary of its discovery will be marked with an exhibition on Amarna, which I am looking forward to visit.The Analysing and Digging Amarna by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"343","Continuing from our previous post, after dirt is excavated into labeled wheelbarrows or buckets, it is transported to one of our screening stations in order to recover all artifacts and other natural materials larger than a designated mesh size, normally 1/8 inch, although we use finer mesh, 1/16″, for pit and post features, and 1/4″ mesh for large volumes of bulk clay that has already been demonstrated to contain little cultural material.  Below is an image of soil ready to be dry-screened on a tripod screen.The next image shows the same screen after all the dirt has been sifted and pushed through the 1/8″ hardware cloth screen.Sometimes, dry screening is either too slow or difficult to get soils with high clay content or extensive roots through, so we use a waterscreening station set up for this purpose.  Below is graduate site supervisor Danielle Dadiego waterscreening a sample from her unit.Documentation and record-keeping are more than pivotal for archaeological fieldwork; they are the whole reason we are doing this in the first place.  In addition to a series of field forms, maps, and catalogs, all students take detailed notes each day in their field books, recording every detail from the weather conditions and their work partners to the excavation strategies they employed and their personal interpretations of what they are seeing in the field.  Below is undergraduate student Brooke Joseph taking a moment to write in her field book.Photography is employed at every stage of excavation, from the beginning to the end of excavation in a unit, taking images of plan and profile views for each level and feature encountered.  The image below shows Michelle Pigott taking an opening image of a new unit laid in today.In the heat and humidity of Florida summers, our crew is fortunate to be able to have lunch each day at a nearby pavilion overlooking the Escambia River, where breezes are more frequent and the mosquitoes less intense.At the end of each week of excavation, we take all students around the excavation areas of the site to provide a guided tour and overview of the findings and ongoing work that week, as shown below.  We conduct similar tours for other visitors to the site, which gives our field director and graduate supervisors an opportunity to get familiar with summarizing information for lay audiences.We hope you have enjoyed this photographic essay of a day of archaeology at Mission San Joseph de Escambe.  Not all days result in equally exciting discoveries, but the slow, cumulative process of conducting archaeological science is immensely rewarding, especially knowing that our daily and weekly fieldwork will contribute to our overall understanding of the Apalachee and Spanish community that existed here more than 250 years ago in the Florida panhandle.For regular updates on our project, which lasts through the end of July, or to read about our previous three field seasons at the site, please visit our project blog. The A Day of Archaeology at Mission Escambe, part 2 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"344","Street sign in BathThis Day of Archaeology 2012 I was on holiday! My wife (not an archaeologist) and I had long promised to take a few days off at the end of what we knew was going to be an exceptionally busy June, so on this Friday June 29th we were taking the day off as part of a long weekend. What do archaeologists do on holiday, you ask? Well this archaeologist goes to the spa. Normally, I’m an archaeologist working jointly between local government and the university sector, and consequently I spend a lot of time cooped up in offices bent over a computer or in meetings about heritage policy and site management. As a result, a good way to rapidly unwind is for me to go to a spa, to move from pool to sauna and back again – and if the nearest/nicest spa to me happens to be in the historically rich and aesthetically pleasing city of Bath, then all the better for it. So, my wife and I got the train over from London and did *not* work on the train but actually read fun, non-work books (unusual in itself). We then pottered around the town pleasantly blending a bit of window shopping, real shopping and lunch, before spending the rest of the day in the wonderful ‘new’ spa complex in the middle of the city with its awesome rooftop pool from which we could laze around in the hot waters, gazing at the historic buildings and idly chatting about everything and anything under the sun. Drinks at a little bar we’d spied earlier followed (a martini being this diggers hit of choice), then dinner at a restaurant well recommended by the bar manager, before home to an early night in our hotel, full of food, snoozy and a hell of a lot more relaxed than the day before. It may not be every archaeologists dream day off, but it works for this one… The An Archaeologist on Holiday by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"346","A bit of an introduction and general update:I am the conservation manager at “Anglo-Saxon CSI:Sittingbourne” [www.anglosaxoncsi.wordpress.com / facebook / @CSIsitt], we reported from the lab last year and are very pleased to be taking part in Day of Archaeology again…Our project has had some periods of closure due to lack of funding over the past year, and we are in the midst of a fundraising campaign at the moment and seeking out new ways to fund conservation of the 2nd half of the Meads cemetery; as well as expand and take forward the CSI shopping mall lab concept. We are open 10-4 Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at the moment, and possibly might add Saturdays for July and August. Although we had to stop conservation work for a large part of last year, work on recording the large bead assembly, and reviewing the results of the conservation work took place, and the Assessment Report for Meads II is with the Canterbury Archaeological Trust editors and hopefully out soon. I shall be away for most of the next 2 months (family illness and then conserving on site for Rutgers University Dig in the Upper Sabina Tiberia Valley, Italy). So today we started to confirm plans to ‘down scalpels’ and carry out a further review of the conservation work and invite volunteers and visitors to attempt reconstructions of our grave groups while I am away. We also need to compile a list of research questions we may have about materials we might want to investigate further, with the portable Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) that is coming to the lab soon – thanks to a generous scientific equipment grant that has recently been awarded to Oxford University (RLAHA) for the CSI project and general conservation use, by the Clothworkers’ Foundation.Our partners, Sittingbourne Heritage Museum have counted well over 18,000 visitors to date; and last summer’s count of conservation volunteer hours topped 5,000 !!The morning’s activities:Heritage Studies MA student Vicky Price interviewing artist Rob Bloomfield about his work with CSI. Volunteer Vicky Price (Heritage Studies [contemporary practice] Kingston University, MA student] and I discussed her work on shield studs from grave 111, and her main task for the day – her desire to interview me and our resident artist, Rob Bloomfield for our views on the relationship between art & science in our work, and processes of how we are working with the CSI project, for her dissertation (working title: “Narrative, craft and the investigative conservator”)Vicky’s interview with Rob then turned into a larger discussion about authenticity vs. creativity in his drawings and also his observations that the work of the investigative conservator is a bit like that of a sculptor, but at opposite ends of the spectrum… and he came up with the term “intricate deconstruction”. It is great to have such a wide mix of people involved with this conservation project… and really great to have Rob’s fabulous range of illustrations – today he was sketching ideas for a poster to advertise summer workshops and this also resulted in a possible new T-shirt design, an Anglo-Saxon Warrior (We have an unusually high proportion of warrior graves at our site)… unfortunately, the sword ended up looking more Roman than Anglo-Saxon, so this is not the final copy – it is an interesting and sometimes tricky collaboration… Rob is an unemployed artist, and this is his first experience working with a professional archaeological project.Rob’s sketches for designing a poster advertising summer workshops “Hands on the Past”Rob’s Anglo-Saxon Warrior drawing (although sword and scabbard should be longer)The A Day at the Shopping Mall CSI lab (Conservation Science Investigations) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"347","Since 2008, archaeologists have been excavating areas of a prehistoric Native American site that covers roughly 478 acres. The site is buried by a meter or more of historic gravel, slag, and trash in East St. Louis, IL and was present from about 900 to 1200 AD. During this time, archaeologists have dug thousands of storage pits and structures (storage, residential, and otherwise). Parts of this site are being mitigated prior to the construction of the new Mississippi River Bridge.Notable artifacts recovered from this dig include a small flint clay figurine found early on in excavations. The importance of this figurine is two-fold; one for its importance to the pre-historic peoples that manufactured it, and second to demonstrate how historic development has impacted the site itself. The figurine was recovered within a burned structure adjacent to a historic drainage trench. Had the trench been shifted, even a few inches, the figurine could have been destroyed or lost entirely.Currently, archaeologists are working in close proximity to construction crews. The bridge is scheduled to be opened by 2014, and our last few excavation areas are situated adjacent to the main construction of the bridge and surrounding roadways.Once excavations are concluded, years of analysis will follow, yielding data that could change the way we interpret the prehistoric history of the region.Today, I woke up before the sun was up; my turn to drive the work truck. After Memorial Day we implemented our early schedule so instead of starting at 8am we start at 7am.At the lab I loaded up the necessary paperwork and equipment for the excavation block I worked in and made my way to the site.Our supervisor (Patrick Durst) had already made the decision to stop field work at lunch today due to the heat. We did the same yesterday.The block I’m currently in (EB14) is expansive, but most all of the features have been dug. All that’s left are a storage pit and a complex of structures. The pit only required a photograph of the profile to show the depth and the different fill episodes. The structure complex, however, required a bit more attention.For me, this block is a bit of a breather. The block I was in previously (EB78) had about 50 people in it at its peak. Granted, there were other supervisors also working in that block. But, it was kind of nice to find out I’d only have to deal with two active feature areas and less than 10 people.The crew in the structure complex continued taking down the basin fill. Within the fill we found an abundance of chert debitage (flakes of stone removed from larger cores or tools). Actually, that’s all we’ve found for the last two days: trays and trays of white (presumably Burlington) chert flakes.They got to the floor surface of the structure and we began defining the architecture. Based on initial observances of the floor, this appears to be a pair of wall trench structures from the Stirling Phase (1100-1200AD).By this time, it was getting close to 11am, so we started wrapping up for the day. Our block is dug down a few feet and foliage has started growing up around it. Add to that the backdirt piles created from the excavation, and the little breeze that is blowing on this hot summer day is greatly minimized. So, we were feeling the bright sunshine and humidity and were grateful for an afternoon in the lab.At the lab I ate my field lunch (half a tomato, half an avocado, two slices of wheat bread, and a peach) and proceeded to the task of preparing for the expansion of the block I was previously working in (EB78).First I had to go back through the paperwork left in the storage bin from that block to ensure it was all complete and ready to be filed away. Once that was done, I found the maps that would be impacted by the expansion of the eastern edge of the block. Studying the maps I found numerous structures that ran into the eastern wall. I set aside the maps and the notes for these features so that the crew expanding the block will know what to look for. We’ll be able to piece together the partial structures and will be able to assign the existing numbers to these known structures. This way, when the structures are dug we won’t have duplicate numbers and all the data will be in one place.And that was my day. I wish I could say that something more exciting happened like I saw a wild dog scavenging a deer carcass on the side of the road on the way to the site or that I saw a building ablaze and billowing a thick black column of acrid smoke into the air… But that was Tuesday and Wednesday.On a personal note, I was given permission by our project direct (Dr. Tom Emerson) to take pictures at the site to document the crewmembers working there. I’ve found that we painstakingly document every feature and every artifact, but when the reports come out the crew are (not intentionally) under represented. As well, I think the general public has a misconception as to what happens at an archaeological site.What I’m attempting to do is to document people working in a “street photography” fashion. And I’m shooting it on black and white film that I’m developing at home in instant coffee and vitamin C. In the end, I envision some sort of an art-book/coffee table book containing the images in an attempt to mainstream the work we do in a positive fashion. Because yes, the archaeology is important, but equally important are the people that put in the hard work making reports on sites like this possible.The Mississippian Archaeology in the Midwest Heat by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"348","Matt Hagar, Beth Pruitt, and Lauren Hicks on the East Cove screen. Source: Kate DeeleyThe weather report says that today is hot and humid. High 101° F.  Heat index near 110° F. The students of the 2012 Archaeology in Annapolis field school from the University of Maryland know that it will be a sweltering and tiring day as they walk through their morning haze to collect their equipment from storage. They also can’t wait to see what they will find today.Two weeks ago, we were in Annapolis. In view of the Maryland state capitol building, we excavated in three backyards, exploring the connections of past tenants to the Naval Academy and to nineteenth century immigration to the United States. For the second half of the field school, we moved to the Wye House plantation on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, home to a line of Edward Lloyds stretching back to the mid-seventeenth century. Here, the students chase the foundation walls of two slave quarters discovered last year.South Long Green students. Source: Ben SkolnikThe site is separated into two parts. The South Long Green is located on the yard of the plantation, within sight of the Great House, and the home of the remains of a two-story brick slave quarter. The East Cove, where the students search for a building called the “Brick Row Quarter” on a historic map, is sheltered by a thicket of trees across the creek from the Long Green.In running the field school, co-directors Kate Deeley, Ben Skolnik, and I recognize that we must perform a balancing act—prioritizing in turns the education of undergraduate students, our PhD dissertation research, and the communication of information to the public. It is a mixture of a classroom and training grounds. The instruction is as much somatic as it is intellectual, and the students have come a long way in their movements within the units, techniques with the trowel, and familiarity with the artifacts and their significance.Richard Nyachiro with his measuring tape. Source: Ben SkolnikThe other element to add to the juggling show is motivation and good spirits, especially on a day like today.  The excitement grows as the brick rubble, glass, nails, and ceramic sherds coalesce into interpretations about where these buildings are situated on the landscape and in time. Despite this, the work is hard and the knowledge that Monday will be their last day to dig their units is beginning to settle in. Conversation is informal and playful—ranging from the childhood nostalgia of Pokémon to everyone’s top desert-island reading choices—and it helps the buckets of dirt go swiftly by.Duncan Winterwyer with his root clippers. Source: Ben SkolnikAfter lunch, the students are joined by Dr. Mark Leone and gather on the East Cove for the site seminars, which are held every Friday. The shade of dense trees is a relief.  One by one, the crew of each unit describes to the rest of the class the accomplishments and interpretations of that week. Using an extended folding ruler as a pointer, the crewmates take turns to indicate features, explain level changes, and point out soon-to-be-excavated artifacts.It is a chance not only for the students to connect their unit to the others within the larger landscape, but also to proudly demonstrate their knowledge and achievements. They grow accustomed to fielding questions about the steps they took and the conclusions they continue to draw from their findings. After the students on the East Cove complete their tour, we move across the creek to the South Long Green.Brittany Hutchinson with her shovel. Source: Ben SkolnikThe students applaud their peers and create a rough circle in the shade of a tulip poplar tree. Though the environment is quite different, this is still a college class. There are weekly reading assignments, and each Friday afternoon the students discuss what they have read. The articles for today, focusing on race, class, gender, and identity in historical archaeology, are Barbara Little’s “She was… an Example to Her Sex” (1994), Maria Franklin’s “The Archaeological Dimensions of Soul Food: Interpreting Race, Culture, and Afro-Virginian Identity” (2001), and Theresa Singleton’s “Race, Class, and Identity among Free Blacks in the Antebellum South” (2001). The students direct the conversation, working through the topics of race, critical theory, politics, and the differences between an archaeology of gender and a feminist archaeology.Like any other class, writing assignments provide a means for the students to individually articulate what they have learned. To balance this academic obligation with the project’s emphasis on  public outreach, the students contribute to the Archaeology in Annapolis blog. They demonstrate their comprehension of the work they complete in their units while also practicing their abilities to communicate this information to a general audience. Undergraduate Paige Diamond’s post, written today, highlights the discovery of the east wall of the two story quarter.Julia Torres Vasquez and Molly Greenhouse create the American Plantation Gothic. Source: Ben SkolnikThroughout the day, Ben pulls students aside to pose for “dirty archaeologist portraits.” He encourages them to take pride in their sweat-soaked, filthy appearance and take pictures with their field equipment. They take possession of this identity—archaeologists in the field. The portraits show the students as they are now at the end of the field school: trained archaeologists armed with the methods and knowledge that will allow them to contribute a unique perspective to this or any other field.To see more archaeologist portraits from today, please visit our Flickr account.

"349","My Day of Archaeology post will feature one project in particular: my involvement in a new creative engagement project which sees a group of like-minded Cardiff based archaeologists, artists and scientists bring the past alive at festivals! This is quite a new thing for archaeologists in Wales, and perhaps the UK, and I believe there’s huge potential to engage with new and broader audiences through this kind of outreach – people that may not usually come and join in on a typical archaeology open day for instance.Guerrilla Archaeology is bringing a range of shamanic activities to four festivals around the UK this summer, offering a chance to come and encounter shamans, past, present and future through archaeology, art, sound and movement. You will be able to explore shamans around the world – who are they, what do they do and how do they think? We’ll be offering you the chance to immerse yourself in shamanic ideas, music, movement and transformation by the use of drums, disguise and ceremony. You will be able to come and dress as a shaman and watch as our experimental archaeologist shows you how to create your own shamanic headdress, or join in on a shamanic drumming workshop, shamanic toolkit or totemic art workshop…. or just come along to meet our own resident shaman!My own background is in the archaeology of worldviews, and this project perfectly pulls together a range of my favourite things, especially the practice and study of shamanism. I studied for a PhD in Neolithic archaeology at Cardiff University, and this project sees  a group of us coming together to celebrate our love of archaeology in a fun, interactive way. You can meet the whole collaborative team on our wordpress blog here: http://guerillaarchaeology.wordpress.com/Practically yesterday, the true Day of Archaeology, I spent most of my day designing and developing a new evaluation form to be used at our Guerrilla Archaeology venture, but also as part of my work at Cadw (which is the historic environment service for the Welsh Government), where I work as the Public Engagement and Welsh Manager. My work is varied but challenging. In fact, I’d consider this job harder than doing a PhD (and I’d totally love to to another one!). The idea for the evaluation form came from my own experience of dreading the end of a training course or event and having to fill out a boring form… so I have created and designed something that will hopefully encourage people to fill the sheet in. It’s not your normal evaluation form, and I haven’t even tested them out, so I’m going to keep the design a secret until we put them to the test at Secret Garden Party – our first festival outing, but don’t worry you’ll get to see them soon, as we will be posting photos of the completed evaluation forms on the Guerrilla Archaeology blog, so watch out for them if you’re following progress…The second job for me on the Day of Archaeology was to write another ‘shamans through time’ blog for the project. I have been creating these as resource packs that can be viewed on the wordpress blog and we will also have these are packs for people to read at the festivals themselves. The next blog is the Bronze Age shaman, which focuses on the Upton Lovell burial in Wiltshire. I’ve literally just finished that, so it’s hot off the press… have a look here: Bronze Age shamanism?Lastly, but maybe most excitingly, I thought I’d let you all have a sneaky peak at the shamanic toolkit I’ve been putting together. It was actually quite useful to set everything out to see exactly what I’ve got to take with me and to visualise what needs to be added. The head-dresses look fantastic, but the challenge now is to create a way to attach these to our heads! A bit of a puzzle indeed!Shaman’s toolkit© Ffion ReynoldsDetail of a shamanic offering, it’s interesting to experiment here…© Ffion ReynoldsA full view of my shamanic toolkit so far. Includes: shaman’s staff on the left; antler head-dress with added ochre; pottery; bone flutes and whistles; flint implements; quartz; beads and organic materials; perforated shells; animal skin.© Ffion ReynoldsJust before I go, make sure you check us out on twitter @guerrillaarchaeo… I also got these in the post:New cards!Hope everyone has enjoyed the Day of Archaeology, so many things happening around the world…- it’s great just to browse through everyone else’s posts!Ffion ReynoldsThe Guerrilla Archaeology: Creative Engagement at Festivals by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Our third post is about underwater archaeology and making documentaries for archaeological sites.Some of our colleagues are doing underwater archaeology, so in the following video you can see their working day, little bit different of  ours working days on the field NGO Archaeologica together with MA Goran Sanev and Michail Stojanovski, archaeologists from Museum of Macedonia made film about the archaeological site Golemo Gradiste – Konjuh in Macedonia. Every year this site is researched by international team of archaeologists from Museum of Macedonia and Ms. Carolyn S. Snively from Gettysburg College, USA and hers students. The film is in post production and it will be presented in about few months.This is how we celebrated The Day of Archaeology 2012.

"351","I am an historical archaeologist who teaches at Cheyney University and at West Chester University, two campuses of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education that are located in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA. I am not teaching during the summer term which gives me time to pursue my research which involves studying the public’s engagement with the archaeological resources in Independence National Historical Park (a U.S. National Park Service property commemorating the birthplace of American democracy). Today, June 27th, has been a ‘catch-up’ day for me where I had time to move ahead on several items on my ‘wanting to do’ list. First, I wrote to the editor of the “Images of the Past” column of the Society for Historical Archaeology Newsletter (Benjamin Pykles) proposing a write-up about Jackson Ward ‘Smokey’ Moore, Jr.  Moore, a retired archaeologist and a Native American Chippewa, excavated in Philadelphia in the 1960’s at the site of Benjamin Franklin’s mansion.Jackson Ward ‘Smokey’ Moore, Jr. in a National Park Service Public Affairs Photo, circa 1960. (Independence National Historical Park Archives).My offer to undertake this write-up required researching the Newsletter’s back issues to determine the type of information expected for the column and I spent an hour doing this prior to contacting Pykles to make sure I had the kind of information wanted. I then turned to some on-going background research I’ve been doing for a possible book project that the art photographer John Edward Dowell Jr. and I have talked about doing. This would be a book designed for the general reader which would feature photographs John took during the excavation of the President’s House archaeological site in Independence Park. These photographs document the archaeological excavation and its findings about slavery and freedom at the birth of the American nation and, in doing so, they help create African American history. They are also art pieces made by a Black artist. Beyond documenting new American history evidence and documenting new African American history evidence, his photographs are art pieces (re’ artifacts) of black visual art. Today I spent time researching and considering how these images therefore fit into the history of Black visual art. After reading a significant portion of N.I. Painter’s Creating Black Americans I realized that Dowell’s President’s House archaeological site photographs not only help make Black history more visible but also help make black art history more “visible” and that this is something we would likely want our manuscript to address given that the history of black visual art, like African American history, has been ignored, overlooked, and excluded in the canon.ne of artist John E. Dowell’s photographs of the President’s House Site in Independence Park (right center, above the blue tarp-covered, back dirt pile). Dowell takes large format images (2 x 5 – 4 x 20 feet) which are then digitally scanned to produce highly detailed, deeply contextualized, images. His photographic style is known to convey life in the urban metropolis and he uses both unique perspective and lighting — namely pictures shot from high-rise vantage points that are taken at sun-up and sun-down.Later on in the day I began typing up the meeting notes taken during the last monthly meeting of the Philadelphia Archaeological Forum (PAF). I am Secretary of that non-profit advocacy group and I post the meeting minutes on the PAF listserv. However, I am coordinating a local version of the Day of Archaeology for the PAF and I switched to work on this task. I am coordinating Philadelphia area Day of Archaeology contributions from local area archaeologists as well as members of the public during the period June 25th-June 28th. I will use these contributions to develop a new page of content for the PAF webpages at www.phillyarchaeology.orgthat will help demonstrate and explain what people in our area do with archaeology both at work and at play. I will also be forwarding the contributions to the coordinator of the international Day of Archaeology blogging project.The logo of the Philadelphia Archaeological Forum, which is based on a commonly found historic dish.The Historical Archaeology & Visual Art by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"352","I have been an archeologist in the U.S. National Park Service for 24 years (can it really be that long?), where I now serve as head of the History Branch at Independence National Historical Park (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Today, June 27th, I spent several hours working with colleagues preparing a small exhibit commemorating the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. This temporary exhibit will feature two ceramic pitchers we recovered in Independence Park during the excavations at the site where the National Constitution Center now stands. The pitchers were found in the bottom of a privy pit (outhouse) that once stood in the backyardbehind the house where Betsy Ross spent her last years.  Did Betsy throw them away?Pitchers found in the bottom of a privy pitMade in England between about 1816 and 1820, the pitchers bear images of two War of 1812 naval engagements in which the fledgling U. S. Navy was victorious over the mighty British Navy.  English potteries produced many such designs specifically for  export to the American market. In so doing, they were helping an adversary celebrate a victory over their own navy. I don’t know if they appreciated the irony in that. I do know that they were glad to find a willing market for their goods.  Whatever they meant to the British potters, for Betsy Ross’ family they probably marked the stirrings of national pride sparked by the War.During the course of the day I also spent time meeting with a colleague from our maintenance staff trying to figure out the safest way to remove an obsolete 1970’s ventilation duct from inside the vault that protects some of the remains of Benjamin Franklin’s house at our in-ground archeology exhibit in Franklin Court. There was yet another meeting today. This last one involved deciding on how the archeologists and the museum curator in the park could best assist a team of faculty and students from Drexel University’s Digital Media program in adding accurate details to a 3D digital reconstruction of the 18th century house in which a African American coachman lived. The reconstruction is base on another site we excavated within the park.…and of course, as every day, there was lots and lots of paperwork to fill out.

The majority of my time will be spent modeling virtual furniture appropriate for the virtual interpretation of the 18th century Dexter House which was excavated in Independence National Historical Park. To better understand how the house may have been furnished Jason Kirk, Professor Muschio and I today visited the park to meet with Chief Curator, Karie Diethorn; Chief Historian and Park Archaeologist, Jed Levin and Deborah Miller, Park Archaeologist, to seek advice and guidance regarding appropriate furnishings.NPS Archaeology LabBeing new to the project, I didn’t have much to contribute to the meeting, other than take in all the information that was being communicated. The main discussion centered on where to find artifacts of the time period to use as models for Dexter house furnishings. I was impressed by the excitement and passion all expressed toward the project. The collaboration quickly came together as ideas flew back and forth, developing what would be in the house, and how it might look.  Field trips to historical sites and museums were planned to study suitable furnishings. The project still has a long way to go, but hopefully we can give people a historically accurate glimpse into the past using today’s technology and the expertise of Park archaeologists, curators and historians.Joseph TomassoFreshman, Digital Media Program, STAR Scholar, Pennoni Honors CollegeDrexel University, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaThe Archaeology, Animation & Visual Effects by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

He and I are engaged in multiple projects aimed at preserving Philadelphia’s rich cultural heritage through the use of current and next-gen digital media technologies. This is a unique opportunity for me, as the Co-Op allows me to combine my passion for digital art and animation with my interest in history.3D models of Dexter House, front and sideOn Monday, June 25th, I finalized preparation of a 3D digital model and animated fly through of the James Oronoco Dexter House.  The archaeological remains of the house were discovered during archaeological excavation of the grounds now occupied by the National Constitutional Center in Independence National Historical Park.  Dexter, a manumitted slave, occupied the house in the 1790’s. The house was used as the meeting place for discussions that led to the formation of the African Episcopal Church, one of the first two Black Churches founded in Philadelphia.Interior hearth of Dexter HouseThe 3D digital model of the house is based on the archeological record, public tax and insurance records and historical photographs of similar houses.

"355","Human beings are odd beasts. So much more than political animals, our ‘habits’ are so varied that they sometimes seem far from habitual. Capable of action on all scales, from building enormous monuments that take millions of people over many generations to a single individual caring for a companion in the face of incurable illness.Yet, go with any person to the place they sleep and you will learn much about them, their society, economics, politics, aesthetics and so on. You can learn from the materials of that space – Do they sleep on a bed? under blankets? are they clean? Do they have Justin Beiber posters? Picasso prints? Turner originals? Is there water by the bed? is the cup glass, pottery or metal?As you learn, you are becoming an archaeologist. You are investigating the intentional and unintentional behaviour of a human being through the materials that form part of their lives. Doing this for another person is difficult enough when they are stood next to you: add thousands of years of cultural distance, destruction and degradation of the objects and the task becomes herculean.The diversity of posts on the Day of Archaeology reflect the huge variety of skills and ideas required to tackle the material remains of our human past. Some investigate the finds, some the people themselves, others look at past environments, and some actually dig the stuff up! Most excitingly, the posts reflect the vast amounts of knowledge, capability and enthusiasm from a fraction of the people who have chosen to make archaeology part of their lives.Pins in a map – a classic artefact made by archaeologists.Archaeologists are  interested in understanding the patterns in human behaviour (if there actually are any habits!)  beyond the scale of a single human being’s experience.One classic way of looking for these is putting dots on maps. Geeky folk like me like to do this with computers but in the (not so) old days this was done with pins and paper.In the postgraduate room at the University of York where I work there is one such map and it has been around for at least 5 years.No one knows what it means.The pins are multi-coloured, some have squares of green paper attached, there are pin holes missing pins. A human being (presumably a PhD student in the recent past of York’s archaeology department) made this map to record their ideas. The records of their PhD have become separated from it. It has, essentially, become a prehistoric artefact.Theories abound as to what the pins might mean – castles or battles of the English Civil War, abbeys dissolved in the Reformation, simply sites that the creator had visited – and the meaning of their colouring – chronology, types of site, nothing at all.I like not knowing. I like using this object as a microcosm for the work of archaeologists – our attempts to read meaning and pattern into the materials left by other human beings. The joy of the puzzle is in it’s unravelling, of playing one possibility against the others, of setting patterns in their context, of changing the tools we use to examine the remains.For the archaeologists out there reading this, there is also a more prosaic lesson in this map: keep better notes! The Mystery, Diversity and the Joy of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"356","What can we do about looting? Lots of people like to theorise, but I tend to prefer to be more practical.I used to work on field projects, trying to prevent looting of archaeological sites on the ground. Partly because one project in Central Asia went very wrong – several archaeologists died, I was treated for PTSD – and partly because I realised that it was futile to try to police every square inch of land, often in war zones, I decided to try another approach.Rather than trying to stop looting often done by poor people desperate to feed their families, I decided to try to identify the material and “burn” it at the art market, in effect prevent it from being fenced. My theory is that most (not all) art dealers and collectors are basically scrupulous people, who want to be able to collect but do not support looting.So I came up with a very simple solution – to create a web site where all the material reported stolen could be listed and therefore identified. It sounds obvious, but no-one has done it before.  Rather than giving the site a long academic name I went for the catchier “Loot Busters” (and yes, it has been hard to resist adding the Ghostbusters theme tune to the web site): www.LootBusters.comDoes it work? Surprisingly, yes. And most dealers are thrilled with the project, as it means they can identify the dodgy pieces. (Okay, a few are not happy with it). I keep thinking that, for example, Nazi loot has mostly been found by now, but a few weeks ago whilst going through the database of material stolen from Poland I noticed an 18th century piece which I happened to know was in a collection in London. Ditto a Venetian painting reported stolen by the Italians I’d seen with a London art dealer. And we’ve even found some antiquities!There are various databases already of looted art, but most concentrate on one area – for example the exemplary Turkish Ministry of Culture web site which lists stolen Turkish material – or are hard to use. The Interpol Database only makes a couple of hundred of recently stolen items available to the public. The Art Loss Register makes no material available to unregistered users, and charges a great deal for searches – an academic wanting to look up a piece they spotted somewhere and think it stolen is unlikely to pay to check …  The Carabinieri Database is unwieldy, with very hard to use search parameters and more often than not returns this message:These days there seem to the thousands of people working on cultural property, and dozens of conferences a year. Honestly, I don’t go to any of them – I hate theorising, and prefer practical projects.I also don’t like the “gotcha” attitude of a lot of people who theorise about looting, so when Loot Busters find a looted piece we tell both the representative of the country from which it was stolen and whoever has it (dealer, collector or museum), so that they can sort it out – we also have a policy of confidentiality, so we can’t boast about our successes … sometimes frustrating, but keeping a low profile and letting whoever is returning the item take the credit works better in the long term.This week I’ve been busy updating the web site, so it’s all sitting at the computer loading photos and typing … Plus we should send out another newsletter soon, so I’ll be working on that this week-end.Most archaeologists’ main concern when it come to looting is Syria at the moment. We keep hearing reports of looting, but little precise information about pieces looted. We’ve posted photos of material that has been reported missing. Damascus Museum seems to be untouched, thank goodness, but Homs, Hama and Apamea have suffered badly. I found photos of the Hama and Apamea Museums on a web site, and the photographer, Dick Osseman, has kindly allowed us to re-post them.This mosaic from Hama Museum is extraordinary, and pretty unique in showing women playing musical instruments – so it should be pretty easy to identify if it appears on the art market:I’ve also been busy this week re-posting images from the Carabinieri Database of material stolen from Italy. It’s going a little slowly as I am trying to sort the material as I go into categories, and then sometimes I break them down further, but the material I’ve added can be accessed through the index here (lots more coming soon): http://www.lootbusters.com/ItalyIndex.htmlSome of the stolen material is so generic I doubt it will ever be possible to identify it (other material I wonder why anyone bothered to steal it, as the financial value probably won’t justify the crime). Other pieces, such as the mosaic above, is extraordinary – I was at a conference in Copenhagen in early May and several of the archaeologists were amazed at some of the stolen material, which they didn’t know about.This Roman relief depicting a theatrical performance on the upper level and a horse race in a Circus below is pretty unique and would be easy to identify on the art market (see: http://www.lootbusters.com/Italy/ItalyReliefs.html):I try to make people aware of the more important pieces, so I often beg David Meadows to blog about pieces on his fabulous blog Rogue Classicism, which is on every archaeologist and Classicist’s must-read list. I’m hoping that he’ll blog this relief soon, just as he blogged this stolen Afghan glass vessel with a relief depiction of the Pharos of Alexandria (here):I tend to downplay the excitement of dealing with looting and looted antiquities – it ain’t nothing like Lara Croft – because most of it is research rather than swinging from vines. One of the things I do love is going through the material and coming across items I probably would have missed, or which bear witness to history. This gold fibula, for example, can be very precisely dated to AD 306-7 by it’s inscription, and was owned by a supporter of Constantine in the years before he became the sole ruler of the empire (http://www.lootbusters.com/Italy/ItalyFibulae.html):This week has been quiet, just sitting at a computer, loading up information. Sometimes things are more exciting, for example when we find a looted item and trying amicably negotiate its return. I know collectors come in for a lot of criticism for buying looted antiquities, as do auction houses and dealers for selling them, but my experience has been that the vast majority of them co-operate when they are told they have looted items, and go out of their way to help.The Loot Busters by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"357","My day of archaeology, like the title says, consistence of lots of little jobs and one big job. The one big job actually has nothing to do with archaeology but pays the bills. I spent the vast majority of my Day of Archaeology working at Gengage. Gengage is the Scottish Healthcare Genetics Public Engagement Network. If it sounds like it has nothing to do with archaeology that is because it does not have anything to do with archaeology. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh after finishing my Masters, after working in CRM in the US. While I got some funding to cover my tuition I still have to pay rent and buy food. So 9 to 4 was spent at the Gengage office making ends meet.However, just because you have a job that has nothing to do with archaeology does not mean you can not make it relevant to archaeology. I spent that 9 to 4 editing videos a skill that has helped me in archaeology and will probably continue to. I used the video editing skills I picked from Gengage to edit the videos of the Barriers to Participation in Archaeology Online workshop. You can see the different videos here, here, here, here, and here. Just because your current job has nothing to do with archaeology does not mean you can’t make it relevant.The rest of my day was broken up into a bunch of smaller jobs for the variety projects I am involved in:Spent an hour on the phone to one of my more archaeology related jobs, Profiling the Profession project with Landward Research. If you do not not know what Profiling the Profession is then check out the Landward website all of the profiling the profession reports are there. We discussed the new project, which is about to get started, and what need to be done over the next few weeks. I won’t bore you with the details.I spent a half hour working on the Open Access Archaeology blog. Basically, I looked at recent open access archaeology publications and made a blog post for each one, about three in total. I also connected the posts with Twitter. All of the posts are in a queue so that if I miss a day a post still goes out. This day I blogged about a new open access issue of Expedition and a new landscape article about the Inca providential capitals, the posts will be out in a few days.I also blogged a little bit about soil identification for archaeologists on my personal archaeology blog. That took up another half hour.I then spent about an hour looking through job adverts on Archaeologyfieldwork.com. Not because I need a job but because it is part of the research I conduct on jobs and pay conditions in archaeology. This mainly involved transferring data from job postings into an excel sheet, FUN TIMES (sarcasm).Finally, I spent about two hours working on my PhD research. This involves working with agent based modelling to create a site predictive model. Right now I am cleaning up one of my models on hydrology, the purpose of which is to get an accurate idea of where water would be in my arid environment. Like all computer modelling I spent about 1hr and 55 mins. trying to figure out why my agents were not doing what they were supposed to and five minutes hating myself because of the stupid coding mistake that was screwing everything up. Here is a pic, not much to look at.It looks like I got a lot done but actually it was not too much. However, that is how I work. I like to break down my work into bit sized tasks that I complete over several days or weeks.The Lots of Little Jobs and One Big Job by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"358","It’s been a typically diverse summer day for me. One of my ongoing projects deals with understanding the initial adoption of pottery technology by the Indian peoples of the Delaware Valley (between roughly 1600 BC and 1000 BC) and subsequent trends in the manufacture and use of pots. Today I reviewed a number of recently published articles on the subject and made arrangements to see collections of pottery from archaeological sites in New Jersey (Gloucester County) and Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). I also continued my review and organization of data from an ongoing excavation project I direct, along with graduate student Jeremy Koch, in the Lehigh River Gorge of Pennsylvania. This location is a fantastic layer cake of deposits left by Indian groups beginning around 11,300 years ago and ending in colonial times. The site was brought to our attention by amateur archaeologist, Del Beck, who was concerned about the site being looted. Del remains an important member of our research team along with my old friend and amateur archaeologist, Tommy Davies, and colleagues from the State Museum of Pennsylvania, Clarion and Baylor universities. We are currently into our 5th year of investigations at the site and are collecting evidence of native cultures that is rarely seen in buried and undisturbed contexts in Pennsylvania. I’m looking forward to my next trip to the site later this week.Michael Stewart, archaeologist in the Department of Anthropology at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA For the record, I’m not an archaeologist. I manage the regional historic preservation program for the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. General Services Administration. The regional headquarters is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania although the region covers six states from New Jersey to Virginia. We undertake a number of projects for the federal government that involve ground disturbing activities and I manage the regional regulatory compliance, including archaeological investigations. On June 25, 26, and 27 I reported to a customer agency about the ongoing investigation of two historic archaeological sites at their project site in southern Virginia, sent copies of correspondence and archaeological resource identification reports to a couple of Native American tribes who expressed interest in being consulting parties to a Section 106 consultation, prepared a scope of work to direct an archaeological contractor to undertake a survey to identify whether or not there are archaeological resources present in a planned project area, and worked on slides describing how to incorporate archaeology into project planning for a training presentation I’ll be giving in a few months.Donna Andrews, Regional Historic Preservation Officer, GSA Mid-Atlantic Region, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA In the evening of June 25, 2012, I edited a draft of a publication being prepared regarding a multi-component prehistoric site (28GL228) located in New Jersey immediately east of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA). The article will be published in the journal entitled Archaeology of Eastern North America and presented at the 2012 Eastern States Archaeological Federation meeting in Ohio (USA). The data from 28GL228 provides insight into Native American culture in the Philadelphia region. This project is being conducted on a volunteer basis. Jesse Walker, MA, RPA I, Poul Erik Graversen, MA (Masters), RPA (Registered Professional Archaeologist), spent most of my Monday, June 25, 2012, doing research for my PhD/Doctorate Degree.  I am currently living and working in New Jersey (USA), not far from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where I grew up; however I attend the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.  Literature on free African Americans in the antebellum northeastern United States is sparse.  The literature that can be found on this very important topic has had little focus on the placement, layout, settlement patterns, and the archaeological record of these people.  My PhD dissertation aims to fill in the gaps of current scholarship focused on African American archaeology in the northeastern United States by means of an in depth analysis of both enslaved and free African American settlements in not only the northeastern United States, but in the southern United States and West Africa as well.  By analyzing the settlement patterns and socio-economic reasons behind the settlement patterns in other parts of the United States and the world, a clearer and more concise picture of the reasons behind the settlement patterns of free and enslaved African Americans in the northeastern United States will emerge.  Most of the information amassed in this regard up to this point stems from a historical perspective, with archaeological contributions and content lacking.  The new information gathered in this dissertation will shed light on the life-ways of these people via the archaeological record of both enslaved and free African American Diaspora in the northeastern United States of America and the ramifications of their extended exposure to European influence in North America.  Poul Erik Graversen, MA, RPA PhD/Doctoral Candidate University of Leicester Principle Investigator/Instructor Monmouth University New Jersey USA Worked in the morning on several writing projects including my material culture based memoir: “Some Things of Value: A Childhood Through Objects”, my essay with my colleague Julie Steele on Valley Forge and Petersburg National Park Service sites, and some new stuff on American Mortuary practices inspired by my attendance and paper presentation at last week’s national meeting of the Association for Gravestone Studies held in Monmouth, New Jersey (USA). At about 10:30 am left Temple University (in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and went to Elfreth’s Alley [the oldest street in the USA) and discussed the excavations now underway, directed by my graduate student Deirdre Kelleher, ably assisted by two energetic volunteers and fellow student Matt Kalos. Three foundations have appeared (not the expected two) and need to be sorted out. Lots of stuff to think about there: the growth of 18th century Philadelphia, perhaps the first settlements there, the 19th century immigration and its impacts, all to be read through material culture; especially the remarkable surviving architecture. Greatly relieved not to get a speeding ticket as I journeyed back to Delaware City (Delaware, USA) where I answered some queries and agreed to some talks; including one on the Fourth of July!! My local historical society is busy trying to save a magnificent mid-18th century farmhouse on an imposing knoll surrounded by lowland farm ground and wetlands. Approved a draft to hopefully speed the preservation process along. Also reviewed the National Register nomination crafted by a group of us working at the Plank Log House in Marcus Hook, Pa., another early structure in the Delaware Valley. Regretfully decided that I could not attend the Fields of Conflict 7th Annual Meeting in Hungary this October. The day ended with a group response, led by my next door neighbor, to save an injured Great Blue Heron which found itself in front of our house. By 8:00 pm the heron was revived and taken care of at a friend’s animal hospital!David G. Orr, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania I spent the day doing fieldwork at Elfreth’s Alley in Old City Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA) as part of my doctoral research.  Elfreth’s Alley, designated as a National Historical Landmark, is credited with being one of the oldest residential streets in the nation.  My research seeks to illuminate the lives of the inhabitants on the Alley, especially the many European immigrants who resided on the small street during the nineteenth century.  This summer, I am working behind 124 and 126 Elfreth’s Alley which house a small museum and gift shop.  During the day I worked with volunteers from the local community who came out to learn about and participate in the excavation.  I also spent time discussing my project with the many visitors who came to the Museum of Elfreth’s Alley.Deirdre Kelleher, Doctoral Student, Temple University, Department of Anthropology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania I am a Rutgers University (New Jersey, USA) lecturer who teaches in three programs (Anthropology, Art History, Cultural Heritage); I also am a sole proprietor archaeological consultant with 25 years of archaeological experience – every day is always busy, diverse in the tasks and projects I work on, and linked with archaeology and anthropology.

He will develop digital 3D models of appropriate furniture and furnishings that will be used to populate the house.  Virtual artifacts will include ceramics recovered from the archaeological site that are believed to be associated with Dexter’s occupation.  The purpose of the meeting was to prepare for a session with Independence National Historical Park representatives on Wednesday, June 27th.  At that Park meeting we will review the house model and will discuss appropriate virtual furnishings with Park experts.  The model has been prepared with advice from archaeologists Jed Levin and Doug Mooney (who excavated and interpreted the Dexter House site) and guidance from Public Archaeologist, Patrice Jeppson and Karie Diethorn, Chief Curator Independence National Historical Park.Glen Muschio, Associate Professor, Digital Media, Westphal College, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Doing archaeology today has entailed a wide range of activities, some not always associated in the public’s mind with archaeology.  I work for a cultural resource management firm. Today’s work has included such mundane activities as reviewing contracts to perform archaeology in Bucks County and the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, USA; firming up logistical efforts to meet with a geomorphologist tomorrow in Delaware County (Pennsylvania); and checking time statements. Fortunately, the day also included putting the finishing touches on an archaeological monitoring report for work in Bucks County. This required nailing down dates for two artifacts found in association with a house foundation. I learned that Pennsylvania in the 1920s and 1930s stamped out automobile license plates with the year that they were issued. I also learned, through a historical marker database on the internet, that the Trenton Brewing company was incorporated in 1891 as a side line business of an ice company and stopped using the name by 1899. These two objects helped to bracket the date of the foundation that had been encountered.  In comparison to the mundane business aspect of doing archaeology, the historical information about the two artifacts, brightened my day. Kenneth J. Basalik, Ph.D. Pennsylvania USA 6/28/12I work for an engineering company in Pennsylvania (USA) and serve as the Vice President of the Philadelphia Archaeological Forum (in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). In the course of the day I went over plans for field and laboratory work for a Phase II bridge replacement project that will be starting shortly outside of Philadelphia. I spent time researching the status of industrial archaeological sites in the city for an encyclopedia article. Indications are that in some neighborhoods in the city, between 1990 and 2007, as many of 50% of the documented and listed industrial archaeological sites were completely or partially demolished, or were abandoned or fell into disrepair. In other neighborhoods with higher property values, more sites were preserved by adaptive reuse. In addition, I spent a portion of the day reviewing and proofreading comments on a visit to a laboratory for a major urban archaeological project in Philadelphia.  In the evening, I attended the monthly meeting of the Philadelphia Archaeological Forum (PAF), an organization that works to promote archaeology in the City of Brotherly Love (Philadelphia).  After the meeting, I began reviewing the report summary for Phase IB/II testing and the data recovery plan for a major highway project in the city. The goal will be to prepare comments on the documents for submission to the agency that is sponsoring the project, on behalf of the Philadelphia Archaeological Forum.Lauren Cook, Registered Professional Archaeologist, Philadelphia, PAThe A Day of Archaeology from the City of Brotherly Love (And Beyond) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"359","One would scarcely guess that a mighty ancient city once occupied the site of Gabii as it is today simply a quiet spot in the eastern suburbs of Rome, Italy. Yet a quick look at the physical landscape and its now dormant volcanic features makes it plain why a first millennium BCE city grew – and prospered – here. The Gabines found themselves at a key crossroads, positioning them well to capitalize on trade in central Italy and to eventually enjoy unprecedented political and ritual friendship with Rome herself, as described by the ancient authors.It was perhaps the fact that the site of Gabii is now abandoned – a rarity for the ancient Latin cities, shared perhaps only with Tusculum – that attracted a team from the University of Michigan to begin work on the site in 2007. A key question for the Gabii Project team then (and now) revolved around a great curiosity of the beginnings of urbanism and its processes in Italy, along with a full exploration of the material culture correlates for the emergence of social hierarchy in Latium. A two-phase geophysical survey revealed a latent street grid that proved a worthy impetus for excavations to begin in 2009.Fast forward three years to June 2012 … the project has now completed two survey seasons, three excavation seasons, and is embarking on its fourth excavation season. Our multi-national team brings students at all levels from all over the world to work in the heart of this extinct Latin city where they learn first-hand the cutting edge techniques of field archaeology. The site is offering up a complex narrative of settlement and abandonment that begins with evidence for Orientalizing period elite burial of infants and continues to Imperial Roman inhumation burials and industrial works, especially those aimed at exploiting the local tufo bedrock. In the middle of the story, so to speak, is a fascinating glimpse of what Italy was like at the mid-point of the first millennium BCE, when archaic elites lost traction and gave way to a differently organized society. The physical evidence of this at Gabii comes in the form of abandoned archaic compounds giving way to a quasi-orthogonal town plan that changes the alignment and apportionment of the city itself.Our team has been in the field for over two weeks thus far in 2012 and while on June 29 we were idled by a public holiday in Rome, the day was a good one for reflection on the project, its participants, and its aims. The dual goals of excavating early Italian urbanism and helping to train a new generation of field archaeologists work surprisingly well in the pluristratified urban contexts of this Latin site. The team looks forward to unlocking more of Gabii’s secrets in the coming weeks and years. The Investigating Urbanism at Ancient Gabii by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"360","I become quite self-conscious when the time comes to write my own Day of Archaeology contribution. Most of what I did yesterday was to carefully read through the posts that were being submitted to this site, adding new tags or assigning them to categories where necessary, and pressing the button marked ‘publish’. If you’re reading this, the chances are you’ve been reading other posts too, and have a fair sense of what the site is about. I love doing this, I learn quite a lot about the world of archaeology in a day (and subsequent days when I catch up on posts I didn’t catch at the time), and it makes me feel very connected to a group of people worldwide who are doing really interesting jobs. As with last year, I’m full of gratitude for everyone who posted, or commented on posts.I did squeeze in a little bit of other work. I spent part of the morning processing a very small sample I took from a site on the Somerset Levels here in England. Archaeologists will often take samples of the dirt they’re digging to be sieved through fine mesh (mine went through 0.1mm today – but 0.5 or 0.25 are more usual). This is to look for tiny artefacts, or biological evidence such as fish bones or seeds. My tiny sample accompanies a much larger sample (c. 40 litres) that will be processed later. I just wanted to get a head start to help the other archaeologists on site know what they were dealing with.Sorting the sample under a microscopeIn this case, the sample was all about the snails, which happens to be my main ‘specialist’ interest in archaeology. The site was an intertidal saltmarsh from the end of the Neolithic until the land was drained in the late Medieval period, but must have been dry land before that as we know the sea level was much lower. Unfortunately, the dry land soil appears to have been eroded by the sea. My sample is important because it comes from underneath the first estuarine layer, in a  patch where the old soil was protected by disturbed bedrock.Some of the snails in the sampleThe image above shows some of the snails from the sample at x20 magnification. Even the few in the picture tell quite nice story. The large one at the top and the one at the right of the middle row are a species called Pomatias elegans. This is definitely a land snail, and essentially a snail that likes a warm wet climate, and lives in disturbed ground in lightly shaded conditions. It didn’t arrive in Britain very quickly after the last ice age, so I know the sample is unlikely to be immediately post-glacial. Nowadays it is declining in Britain – it still lives in Somerset, although not on the site I’m working on, and it seems to have been more common in the more humid climate of the Mesolithic. The round snail on the middle left and bottom left (the one on the middle left is the bottom side of the shell) are a species called Discus rotundatus which is a very common species in shaded places today. Like Pomatias elegans, it was quite late to arrive after the last ice age, with evidence from several studies suggesting it became common and replaces a close relative found in cold climates called Discus ruderatus around 8500 years ago. The tall, thin snail at the top left and in the centre of the middle row are a species called Clausilia bidentata which tends to live up trees and on logs (it can also be found on walls). The snail at the bottom right is a juvenile of quite a common species called Cepaea (probably Cepaea hortensis, but I haven’t looked closely enough to be sure yet). European (and east coast American) readers might recognise this shell as large-ish yellow shell, often with brown bands. The colour comes from a layer of protein called the periostracum, which usually deteriorates when the shell is buried – although the brown bands are often preserved.My hunch then is that the context this sample comes from datesfrom before the site was inundated by the sea, most likely the Mesolithic or early Neolithic, and that the environment at the time was shaded, possibly woodland. I will be able to say more when the larger sample is processed – hopefully containing seeds, small mammal bones and maybe flint microliths, but looking at this small sample now allows me to tell the archaeologists who will be on the site next week that this context might contain some of the site’s earliest finds. The A Day of Day of Archaeology (and Snails) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"361","Tuesday, June 26I have recently proposed an online course for the Institute of Continuing Education at the University of Cambridge. My day started with a meeting at Madingley Hall to discuss this idea with the manager of the courses. The online provision is a novelty at Cambridge and the manager has been surprised how many of the customers are apparently totally new to the ICE and create a truly global audience. Thus, my idea needs a rethink in order to fulfil their remit to be able to run the course at least three times and reach a wider audience with a less area-specific title. The course seems to stay in development. Luckily, the manager has to put on his second hat as the manager of the International Summer School so I will have until late August or September to brainstorm.After the meeting I headed to the University Library to check the dates suggested for the calibrated chronology of the late central Italian prehistory. The book in question seemed to be in the open collection so I decided to go the Department of Archaeology first. I had a series of illustrations to do for an article; thus, I needed to scan some slides with a slide scanner and to check old GIS coverages in order to edit the figures needed for the wetlands volume Water : Movement – The importance of rivers, lakes and wetlands in prehistoric societies edited by Andrea Vianello. It turned out that the slide scanner had not been connected to the network since the last network update and I had to get the departmental computing officer David Redhouse, the network administrator required to add an USB appliance, to come and get the scanner online. In addition, for some reason scanning slides is always prone to random difficulties. This time one slide turned all black and one bright red; if only one had foreseen how redundant the old photographic forms were to come and how quickly slide scanners became obsolete. I shiver with the thought of upgrading from the current modes of storing them.I scanned the slides for the illustrations and saved them in order to edit them later and proceeded into creating a series of new ArcMap coverages in order to have the correct features in my figures. Since I can edit all new CorelDraw files further at home later during the week, I just created the content I needed and imported it to the CorelDraw for later editing and use. The day finished with fetching the book I had looked for in the online catalogue earlier from the stack in the UL and updating the dates taken from my PhD. University Library at Cambridge Wednesday, June 27This morning saw me giving a lecture in the Exploring Art course (Makers and Materials II) in the Embrace Arts. This course is part of the Art History lecture series in the Richard Attenborough Centre at the University of Leicester. These courses are organized by the Institute for Lifelong Learning at Leicester. The course director was sitting in this time in order to assess me and start the process of including me officially in the tutor panel. Considering that W. G. Hoskins taught at the Vaughan College and for the Workers’ Educational Association, I am not in bad company. My lecture is about to start The lecture on Phaidias at Olympia, a topical subject due to the arrival of Olympic flame relay to Leicester on Monday, went well and the learners seemed interested and enthusiastic.In the afternoon I started to edit the illustrations but managed to make very slow process, since I had to crosscheck different place names mentioned in the text and their locations. Thursday, June 28In the morning I uploaded my archaeological blog ‘Landscape Perceptions’, where I did blog about this Archaeology Day last week. This week’s topic was ‘Summer Season of Archaeological News’ in which I discussed some Roman glass beads from Japan. I try to be topical; thus, I have reviewed both Pub Archaeology and Mary Beard’s excellent ‘Meet the Romans’, while discussing important archaeological topics. As a busy working mother, I am lucky to be able to keep a weekly blog!On this particular day I had to make some preparations for my coming short work trip to Rome. I have to keep my Italian mobile number alive by crediting it at least once a year. This I could have sorted otherwise – online or bothering colleagues – but for drawing a few diagnostic pieces of pottery for an article I am preparing and meeting the new inspector for Crustumerium where I excavated between 2004 and 2008 you have to travel to Italy. In order to make swifter moves from the airport to the centre, from the centre to the Institutum Romanum Finlandiae, where I store some utensils, and from Rome to Civita Castellana, I have hired a car. I try to make this trip on a shoestring so avoiding the extra insurances in the car rental place is paramount. Thus, I had to buy a car hire excess insurance online that was much cheaper than any tie-ins.Secondly, I needed a new cabin trolley. My husband will be leaving almost immediately for Turkey for work on my arrival so he could not lend his but I had to go to the city centre to buy a new one. I managed to spend almost two hours while comparing models, weights and volumes in different department stores and to lose my toddler son in the process. It is good to know that the security in the shops can be used to spot runaway children with extra energy…I also had to send a recent article, out about a month ago, to the inspectors in different Superintendencies whose areas I was discussing in my article ‘Political landscapes and local identities in Archaic central Italy – Interpreting the material from Nepi (VT, Lazio) and Cisterna Grande (Crustumerium, RM, Lazio)’. In addition, there were e-mails from the first hostel I am staying in Rome and a follow-up message from the lecturer responsible for the Landscape History courses in the Institute of Continuing Education at Cambridge to deal with. I also finally received a photo register file from my assistant. Friday, June 29As I suspected, my Friday looks like it will be less than exciting. I have to do a job application, continue editing and compiling illustrations for the article I now have the material for and look at briefly some other texts in order to make progress on them. I will look at the summary of the activities before turning off my laptop in the early evening. Editing illustrations *          *          *Not unsurprisingly the time flew and I barely got the illustrations ready – all 15 of them. I also wrote the list of captions and inserted the references into the text. There is one illustration I am not happy with but I have to do it later; its colour scheme does not take the change to the greyscale well. I may also have to include a 16th figure in order to show more of the real landscape in a photo. The other texts have to wait until next week.

"362","I spent my day today at Ferry Farm, the boyhood home of George Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  George lived in this home for most of his childhood, and it remained in his family for quite some time after he moved out.  Archaeology at Ferry Farm has been taking place for many years in an attempt to create a better understanding of the land and the life of the Washington’s during their occupation of it.  This year’s excavation is taking place behind the Washington home site (excavated in 2008), and our goal is to uncover the location of the outbuildings that supposedly stood there.  I just completed a five week field school at this site and had such an incredible experience that I elected to return as a volunteer for the rest of the summer.  Today was my first day back, and I was eager to start digging!Upon my arrival I was immediately assigned a new unit to begin excavating with my good friend and digging partner, Victoria Garcia.  This unit is located in a particularly fascinating section of the site, as several odd soil anomalies and a myriad of strange artifacts have been discovered there.  Artifacts have included plastic toys, Civil War-era bullets, various historic ceramics and most of a porcelain teacup.  I have been very interested in all of the excitement that this particular area has stirred up over the past couple of weeks, so getting the opportunity to dig here was a real treat for me!  We began by chopping up the topsoil with our shovels and removing it in small squares, which took significantly less time than I thought it would!  Upon removing the layer of matted down grass and dirt, we came across a metal pipe that was sticking directly out of the ground.  No one was quite sure what it was, but I am eager to find out as we excavate further!  After removing the top layer, it was time to screen the matted down chunks of grass and dirt for artifacts.  We found a piece of a terracotta pot and some nicely decorated ceramics, but nothing more than that in this layer.Our unit after removing the topsoil this morning.While we were screening a group of children from a summer camp program came to visit the site and helped us go through our topsoil.  Ferry Farm is a public archaeology site where guests are encouraged to get their hands dirty at the screens as they learn about our work there, and I always enjoy being able to entertain and educate them.  The kids who joined us were very helpful and I appreciated their enthusiasm, despite the fact that our dirt was terribly difficult to pick through and had close to no artifacts in it!By the time we were done screening it was time for lunch, and instead of returning to our unit after eating, Victoria and I headed to the lab with our classmates, Ian and Allison.  There, we joined our professor, Dr. Bernard Means, who was scanning Ferry Farm artifacts with his 3D scanner.  The four of us will be getting involved in his scanning project as interns this fall, so today was somewhat of a tutorial and demonstration for us.  The scanner makes 3-dimensional digital copies of artifacts, which can be studied and saved on the computer, and even replicated with a 3D printer!The pewter spoon with the initials “BW” on it.He first scanned a pewter spoon that is inscribed with the initials “BW”, which belonged to George’s sister, Betty Washington.  It was amazing to be able to see this piece in person, as I had only ever read about it or seen it in pictures prior to today.  Dr. Means also scanned a lead alloy cloth seal, a small metal hatchet toy, and finally, a Civil War Minie ball bullet that Ian found during our field school.The Minie ball as it is being scanned.The scan of the Minie ball as it appears on the monitor.In all, it was a great day in the field and in the lab!  I love every minute of what I do here, and I feel so lucky to be a part of such a wonderful profession.  I’m glad I could share my experiences at Ferry Farm with everyone here today, and I can’t wait to read what others are up to on this Day of Archaeology!The A Day at George Washington’s Ferry Farm by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"363","After the inital excitement of the arrival of new material in the lab, curiosity had to be curbed and the main task of the day tackled. This task was to process and interpret anayltical data acquired last week during many days work on the SEM. I use many different analytical techniques to investigate the more important archaeometallurgical residues passing through the lab – and the analytical SEM is one of the most useful.Backscattered electron image of a tapped Roman iron smelting slag. The field of view is 2.5mm. The backscattered electron images reveal compositional contrasts through their grey scale. In this image the dominant phase, appearing pale grey, is fayalite (an olivine mineral, approximately Fe2SiO4).Across the centre of the image is a discontinuity, produced by the chilling of the surface of an individual lobe of slag as it flowed from the surface and cooled in the air.The crystals are large, suggesting the slag cooled slowly, and the lobe margin is not marked by the development of much iron oxide, so this example probably cooled right in the mouth of the furnace.As well as producing these images, the analytical SEM also permits chemical microanalyses from tiny spots or areas of the sample.The second backscattered electron image shows a tiny detail of the first image, with the location of microanalyses.Detail of Roman tapped iron-smelting slag. Field of view is approximately 0.17mm. The instrument provides the chemical analyses, but they then have to be recast as mineral formulae – and that was today’s task. With many hundreds to do that was a substantial task in front of the spreadsheet. Gradually a picture emerges of the overall composition of the slag and of its constituent minerals.In this instance, the slag proved to be typical of residues produced during the smelting of iron ores from the Forest of Dean. That is a useful result in itself, allowing one aspect of the economy of this Roman settlement to be understood. As other samples from the same site are interpreted further details will emerge – permitting reconstruction of the yield and efficiency of the furnace as well as aspects of the technology itself.Processing microanalytical data, to convert the microanalyses into mineral formulae. Archaeometallurgical residues provide a very direct link back to a particular occasion in the past, when an artisan did a particular job in a particular way. The waste material provides key evidence for that moment in time. Although studying the waste, rather than the product, might seem perverse, there is often a richer set of evidence about hte nature of the process to be gleaned from the residues than from the artefact. Crucially, the residues also typically remain close to the site of the activity, whereas the products were dispersed after production and may not be able to be linked back to their point of origin.Careful investigation of such archaeometallurgical residues may allow us to come as close as we ever could do to looking over the shoulder of the Roman smith at his work.The Making Sense of Analytical Data by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"364","This 2012 field season marks the third summer that the University of Idaho (UI) has held an archaeological field school at the Kelly Forks Work Center site, a prehistoric upland hunting camp on the North Fork of the Clearwater River in north-central Idaho. I’m Laura, a graduate student at UI and my master’s thesis will detail our investigations from 2010 through 2012. The field work schedule goes from Mondays through Thursdays so my hands and feet are cleaner today than they have been all week. I have spent my June 29th copying forms, writing emails, uploading photos, and performing a myriad of other minor tasks (removing sediment from equipment) and domestic routines (laundry) which are all reserved for Fridays. I don’t think much elaboration is needed on this aspect, but it’s all linked to recuperation from the labors of this week and preparation for that of next week.The field school is about teaching students the practical and technical methodology of documenting cultural material and connecting these efforts with the overall context of human activity in the region. It is because of their diligence and hard work that a segment can be added to the story of some of Idaho’s early residents. Surrounded by the steep ridges of the Bitterroot foothills and tall forests of cedar, white pine, and Douglas fir, the 150 acre terrace where Kelly Creek joins the North Fork has clearly been an important stopping place for at least 10,000 years. The abundance of stone tools and debitage recovered from temporal occupations dating from the early to the late prehistoric periods provides a glimpse of a way of life that involved a strategic knowledge of local and regional resources. Hunting, fishing, and game processing were important pursuits of the people who utilized the site while the low-lying meadows and flood plains overlooking the river likely provided an excellent setting to repair and manufacture the tools that were used to accomplish these pursuits.The first two summers at Kelly Forks resulted in the recovery of eight stemmed lanceolate bases stylistically associated with the Western Stemmed Point Tradition and the regional Windust phase (ca. 8,000 – 11,000 years BP), the earliest period of occupation in the Clearwater drainage. Five projectiles, both uniface and biface, dating to the Cascade phase (ca. 5,000 – 8,000) were also encountered along with anvils, two net weights, a sandstone shaft abrader, and numerous modified flakes and cobble tools. Recently the May 2012 issue of the UI alumni magazine, Here We Have Idaho, featured Kelly Forks and the findings from 2010 and 2011.Next week will be our fourth this season and excavation so far has added three stemmed lanceolate bases, four Cascade phase tools, a third net weight, and a second shaft abrader to the assemblage. The late prehistoric component has similarly been strengthened by the appearance of several small side-notched and corner-notched arrow points in the upper strata. We are in the process of investigating a potential fire pit and have opened several trenches to connect anvil features and artifact concentrations that were encountered last summer. By summer’s end we’ll be in the midst of compiling all of the new obsidian for sourcing, selecting charcoal samples for radiocarbon dating, and painfully agonizing over which tools to send for residue testing. For now, I’m looking forward to the next few and final weeks (so little time!) of excavation. Part of the charm of doing archaeology is the thrill of not knowing precisely what is in store and it seems each week is better than the last. Kelly Forks is my thesis site and working there has shaped me in ways I’ve probably not yet realized. I know it will always be a special place for me; perhaps I share this with those who were also there long ago…Field school students hard at work on June 25; the North Fork of the Clearwater River is visible at the base of the slope beyond.The Archaeology at Kelly Forks, North Idaho by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"365","I have been working as an archaeologist at an archaeological consultancy firm, since late last year and today is a rare day for me – a day in lieu! As this hasn’t been very exciting, I will document the day for which I earned this time off..Since joining my work place, most of my work has been based in our Melbourne head office. We take on a variety of clients, and one of our biggest projects is based in the Pilbara desert, Western Australia, where a number of iron ore mines have been, or are currently being, constructed. The Pilbara desert is also home to some of our richest and previously undisturbed Indigenous heritage, and there are several practices that mining companies must observe prior to developing the land in accordance with Western Australian Indigenous heritage legislation. This is where we come in.For most of the year, my work has included managing the data that has been sent back from the field in the Pilbara and writing reports (there are lots to be written!), most of which are applications for Ministerial consent to disturb archaeological sites. Following the completion of one such report and the receipt of Ministerial consent to conduct excavations at a number of sites, I was sent with one of our teams out to the desert to take part in these excavations. This was my first time out to the Pilbara, and I was quite nervous! Western Australia is home to some of our deadliest snakes, and the first thing I saw when I arrived at our accommodation was a sign outside my door reading ‘beware of snakes’. It struck me then just how far from the office I was..The day on which this photo was taken was characteristic of my two week ‘swing’ (or fieldwork stage) out on the mining site. We generally rose at 5.15am, leaving us time to eat breakfast and pack our lunches before meeting the rest of the team at 6am. We usually arrived on site by 6.20am, working through until 4pm. This photo was taken towards the end of the swing, and on this day we were working in a lovely, large and shady site and were conducting excavations. We found a range of cultural material at the site, making it a particularly interesting working day, and the three archaeologists present took it in turns at excavating, sieving and site recording. Also on site were field representatives of the mining company and the Traditional Owners, who we work very closely with in all areas of our archaeological site investigations.Working in the Pilbara also meant working closely with wildlife! A number of snakes were spotted on this day (thankfully, not by me), and we received a visit from this curious gecko during our lunch break.. After a cuddle and a photo opportunity, he was  returned to his rock in the sun where he watched us work for the rest of the day, apparently finding our ‘day of archaeology’ as interesting as we did. After packing up our equipment, we then headed back to camp for showers, dinner, and a mid-strength beer or two.And now that we’re safely home in Melbourne, here comes the really fun part – writing up the excavation report! The Archaeology and Mining (and Reptiles!) in Western Australia by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"366","The truth is, the closest I got to archaeology today was watching my 4-year-old and her dance class perform in their “Jurassic Arts” Dinosaur dance show. But this weekend will be different as I turn my attention to archaeology for children. A few weeks ago, one of my daughter’s friends earnestly explained to me that “paleontologists dig for dinosaur bones, and archaeologists dig to learn about Egypt.” (OK, a little limited geographically, but that is pretty good!) These kids, and many others like them, have inspired me to take on this small, “easy” project of creating an archaeology excavation / activity table for a local children’s museum that will open soon. We only have essentially a 2 m x 1 m box in which to convey the main points of archaeological excavation to the 3- to 10-year old crowd, while providing fun and entertainment as well. And what would an archaeological project be without the smallest of budgets!Of course even a simple project is not without its challenges. Finding inexpensive, kid-friendly artifact replicas has proven to be more time-consuming than finding the coveted fluted point at my last Paleoindian dig. And after my 4-year-old drew blood from my 7-year-old with my Marshalltown, I’m still on the search for suitable tools. I think I’ll go get some whisk brooms and toothbrushes next. It has been an adventure just working out the logistics of this one exhibit, especially in trying to find the common ground between what’s important to us, and what’s interesting for kids…We’ll be working on installing the activity table this weekend, and I hope to post more about our progress.

"367","Among other things, I chose archaeology for one primary reason – I did not want to be stuck in an office working nine to five.  Inundated with commercial television, I assumed, as many, that archaeology was all about traveling to exotic places to solve ancient mysteries of long-lost civilizations.  Archaeology, not dissimilar to the adventures of a certain Dr. Jones, was about adventure and big, spectacular discoveries.  My 18-year-old self would probably be horrified to learn that I do, in fact, work nine to five and much of the discoveries I deal with are neither ancient nor big.  In fact, now, I commute on a bicycle, work in an air conditioned Toronto office, and get to sleep in my own bed every night.  I work in commercial (aka CRM) archaeology as a report writer and a material culture analyst and I get REALLY excited if my Euro-Canadian site pre-dates 1800 AD.  Despite all this, I am happier and much more self-fulfilled than my 18-year-old self ever imagined myself being.Today, I spent my day analyzing artifacts from a survey of an 1830s to 1850s Euro-Canadian farmhouse located about an hour’s drive north of Toronto and as far as big ancient mysteries were concerned, it was neither big nor ancient nor particularly mysterious.  In fact, it was a scatter of early-to-mid nineteenth century artifacts that was sparce by any standards.  The occupants of the site, tenants who were among the earliest settlers in the area, lived a frugal existance in a sparcely occupied landscape that did not warrant a large accumulation of material goods.  The number of tenants that occupied the site is unknown and the site’s name comes from an individual who is listed on the property only once in an 1837 directory for the area.  This is no grand Egyptian temple.Ceramics, a bottle base, buttons, a pipe, and some nails:  A small sample of the artifacts from an early nineteenth-century Ontario farmstead.Yet, this small site is an excellent example why archaeology, especially historical archaeology, is important.  Much of all written history was written by the privileged elites who, through their perceptions of what is significant and fundamental left to us a written record that has narrowed our vision of the past by reproducing in us what they considered important.  Archaeology challenges the bias of written history since the disposal of refuse is a universal activity done by everyone within any given society.  While the archaeological record can be obscured, manipulated, and altered, the traces of past human activities remain to be discovered and interpreted.  By that fact, the study of that refuse, archaeology, is an increadibly democratic process.Nowhere is this more true in historical archaeology than the excavation of lowly log cabins of early European settlers.  From politics, economics, cultural norms, and the geography of the land itself, the work and social interactions of countless of individuals in the recent centuries has transformed the economic and social landscape into what is recognizeable today.  Over the years, historical archaeology has contributed to the understanding of a variety of topics including the development of modern foodways, the growth of industrial capitalism, and the institutionalization of present day socio-economic hierarchies.  Yet, these studies have started through the analysis of simple sparce farmsteads occupied by more-or-less nameless individuals such as the one I’m working on.  The lives of the people that discarded these ceramic sherds and pieces of bottle glass had a lasting effect on the sorts of lives we experience today.  These people have lived as long and as complex lives as we have and yet we do not know who these people are and have only vague ideas about their daily lives.  Their non-degradable material on farmstead and concrete-covered urban lots is the only record they left behind for archaeologists to study.  It is through this record we can know something about them and thus know something about ourselves.  Every day, the work of contract archaeologists continues to discover and document humble homes of lowly individuals and it is up to us to tell their stories and interpret our findings, we owe them that much for all the world they have created.Pen, paper, and plastic bags in front of a computer: The necessities for analyzing artifacts.Anatolijs VenovcevsHistorical ArchaeologistToronto, OntarioThe In Small Things Remembered by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"368","Well this is my first year of joining in with Day of Archaeology, (and first time of writing a blog); being an independent archaeological consultant (posh name for a small company), I thought I would actually give an idea of how the day panned out, the good the bad and the ugly, rather than a more bland “we do this, we do that” report.The Morning SessionThis morning I was on a watching brief, which can be highly exciting or highly frustrating, and sometimes darn-right odd.  At least on this brief, I was only going to be needed for about three hours as long as nothing was found as the site was in a small backyard.  Now though it is commendable that a watching brief was added as a building condition, the desktop and local knowledge indicated that there would be nothing to find.However, it was also somewhat complicated by the building contractor, who is obsessive when it comes to health and safety, full and complete personal protective equipment will be worn at all times whilst on site, and that applies to everyone, with no exceptions…….and that included the dog!Now very much as expected on this site the trench went in, and all that was exposed was previous disturbed ground, dating from the days the estate was built (1960′s), so measurements taken, photos taken, quick drawing made, and then homeward bound.  I’ll write this on up this evening, as it will be very much a ‘template’ job.Don’t get me wrong, I like those with absolutely nothing in, but I love those that yield finds, or give indications to our past, that is when I come into my own and have no compunction into taking as long as I can, which can miff a builder off.The Afternoon BitWell this afternoon was going to be a bit unusual anyway, as I have picked up a commission to produce eleven consolidated information sets for Iron Age sites in the county I live in.  The sites are small, some have been excavated in the past, some have not, some have been written about, other have not, but what all having common is that they are never accessible by the public, as they all lie within a restricted military training area.OK I hear you saying this is just a standard desktop assessment, but in this case it is more much more, it is a consolidation of all known archaeological, environmental and historical information on the site, from the time it was first recorded through to modern times, which unfortunately due to the location of the sites, means the damage to them.  I am lead to understand that if I get these right then I will get a lot more, it is not about condition reporting it is about producing a ‘log book’ for each site, a sort of living documentOn the plus side there is no invasive or non-invasive investigation required, it is purely based on previously recorded information. However, no matter how laudable that may sound, I still visit the sites, I still look at the landscape, and more importantly I still try to feel and understand why the site is located where it is.  I do this so that when I correlate the facts, I can give them some degree of life by emphasizing the more important aspects.So this afternoon I toddle off to visit one of the sites, I have been there before and it is one where information dates back to 1810, thanks to William Cunnington, but I just need to absorb an aspect of the landscape and to check the current condition, as the latest report has indicated some damage to the site since I was last there.Sure enough I arrive at the site and yes there is some minor damage, thankfully nothing that rings major alarm bells, but is is man made, caused by one of the tracked vehicles that train in the area.  This will need emphasising in the report, as despite begin protected, damage is still being permitted, and somehow I feel that the damage could have been avoided by the simple expediency of moving one protections post.  Even though not rewired in the report on the site I decide that I will add this as a non published addendum to that particular report.Now due to the environmental issues of the area that theses sites are located in a degree of sense is applied to those that train there to prevent further damage, and in areas where training is undertaken mobile loo’s are to be found, but sometimes I do smile at the instructions……. But enough of the flippancy I hear you say, but to me that is part and parcel of what keeps us sane, keeps us focused and drives to to produce excellence all the time, irrespective of if you are in a trench studiously working on a section, you will be chatting laughing and joking, or if you are writing a report for Day of Archaeology, you will think back to find what warms your heart and makes you smile.Right I will concede for now, and get back to the seriousness of the day……..On the way home I drop into the local museum, as I am honoured to live so close to Devizes Museum, and spend a short time in the library, extracting yet another report from the archives of the Wiltshire Archaeological and natural History Society magazine, this time form 1917, which will be used in one of the reports I am writing.From there homeward I head, knowing that this evening will be spent writing reports.On to the eveningThe Watching Brief doesn’t take long, well there is only so much you can write about nothing, then I get on with the commission work, finally I start to reflect on the day, the past week, what has worked and what has held me up, and one fo the things that holds me up time and time again, is that old issues of local archaeological groups reports are not available on line, such as in ADS, and today was a good example, the excavation report dated from 1917, is it not about time that was available on line, as I know that work is being and has been duplicated because there is no virtual repository.Yes I know it our responsibility to seek the information, but times are changing, and I do get annoyed when I phone a society to obtain an extract only to be told that if I want it I must travel 200 miles to view it in their library.  We are in a time when information should be easily available, OK I am NOT saying digitise the latest information, but after 25 years then digitise it, that way if a society owns it they can still charge a few pounds for the digital copy,where as if they dont it will eventually get copied on to the t’interweb in a way they loose out and for heavens sake why cant they at least maintain a digital on-line index, that alone would save hours and hours of work…….. Sorry Rant over.And finally the nightSo to finish the day off, I write this, from the heart without to much planning, the good the bad and the darn right ugly.Next year I promise to try and have an interesting day, but that will depending on who I am contracted by, and more importantly what I am doing work on.  Now had this been a week ago I could have discussed the Saxon remains I was dealing with and the issues with builder when they were found!So until the Day of Archaeology 2013Tim DarchAKOT HeritageWiltshire[All images are owned by myself, if you wish to use them please feel free to do so]The Just Another Day, Sort Of by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"369","I know I am not the only professional archaeologist that deals with members of the public that are curious about archaeology. I encourage questions and interest from people that are genuinely so. Tons of non-professional archaeologists contribute to our understanding of the past through advocacy, volunteer work, fundraising, and good ol’ moral support. Avocational and amateur archaeology groups across the country work side by side with professional archaeologists and organizations. These are great relationships and interactions I enjoy.One part of my job that I would rather not have to deal with is illegal digging and collecting. I know wishing it away won’t make it go away. I know that education and outreach is the right path to understanding and appreciation. However, there are those individuals that test my patience. We have all met them. These are what I call professional looters. They are not interested in learning about the people that lived in the past. They are not interested in preserving the archaeological record and the knowledge of it for future generations. They are not interested in sharing knowledge. These individuals are interested in “my point is older/bigger/more complete/more rare (fill in the blank) than yours” and “how much is it worth.” These individuals steal from our shared history for the benefit of themselves. I do not like this group of individuals.I was fortunate this field season to not be inundated with these types of people at our field site. My luck ran out on the afternoon of the last day of actual fieldwork. The encounter was typical as far as talking with looters, yet also very strange. What follows is my “open letter” to the individual I met that day.Dear Un-invited Site Visitor (aka, Looter Dude),It was so nice of you to drop by this afternoon while my undergraduate students were in the middle of their Field School Practical Skills Test. Your presence was absolutely not a distraction for them or me. I am always more than happy to take 30 minutes time away from the people who are completely serious about their studies and desire to become professional archaeologists (and are paying good money for the education they are receiving), or are genuinely interested in learning about people and the past. To that end, if we had had more time to chat I would have been able to clarify a few points for you:(1) Not only is it inappropriate to ask someone whom you have just met how much they make, it’s gauche and none of your business;(2) Feigning interest in professional archaeology and how one “becomes one” is not cool; especially when it is clear you are trying to pump the real professional archaeologist for information about her/his site;(3) Items taken from public lands are not yours to “donate” back to said public lands. They are stolen. This does not make you a philanthropist. It makes you a thief.(4) Collecting along the edge of private property is still collecting from (and trespassing on) private property. I happen to know you do not have permission to be on said property. Please leave quickly and quietly.(5) The casualness with which you dropped the names of several types of “arrowheads” that you have found in the area was very smooth. In case you didn’t understand my reply “My interests in the past are more than just the lithics” – I meant – rocks are rocks if you can’t tell me where exactly they came from; I am not impressed. Actually, I was bored.I am also curious about you, dear visitor. Do you mind answering a few questions for me?(1) If you truly only make $17,000 a year cleaning pools, how can you afford a not-too shabby sports car?(2) While we are discussing your car, what is up with all of the un-provenienced artifacts in your cup holders and console? Is this part of your donation?(3) Don’t you think you were being a little pushy when you left me a phone message only 30 minutes or so after meeting me? I might think you were desperate, but your rant on my university voicemail came across as snarky and anti-social. (FYI — I now have the make/model and license plate # of your car; you name; and your phone number — I’ll be sure to pass them along to interested colleagues and law enforcement.)(4) FYI – the “Ph.D” after my name means you can call me “Dr.” Ms. is a bit out-dated and shows your ignorance.Again, thanks so much for stopping by the site this week. I know you were nervous to talk to me and I appreciate that you put on your good camo t-shirt over your wife-beater. It definitely made you seem more legit.Sincerely,Professor XCup holder in looter’s car with unprovenienced artifacts.The Open letter to un-invited and unwanted site visitors by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"371","While surveying, you sometimes find unexpected things–like blueberries! Yum.I’m a project manager at a contract archaeology company, which means I have to be both an archaeologist and a businesswoman.  Anathema to purists, maybe, but in the United States most archaeology is done commercially, as part of an industry called Cultural Resource Management (CRM), and businesses need people doing business-y things to keep them running.  In CRM, developers hire archaeologists and architectural historians to help them deal with cultural resources that will be affected by their development project, in much the same way as they hire environmental scientists, traffic engineers, and architects.  We work for the developer, but our first duty is to the resources.For me, the 2012 Day of Archaeology was pretty typical.  My primary task for the day, as it has been for the last month or so, is to continue editing a site report.  The archaeologist who wrote the report works mostly on prehistoric sites, but this report is about a historic site.  Since it’s her first historic-period report, we’re taking our time with it to teach her how to do it right.  Historic-period artifacts require completely different analysis knowledge than prehistoric artifacts (e.g., learning to recognize mold seams on bottles or differentiate fabric types in ceramics, vs. categorizing edge flaking in stone tools), which takes time to learn.  You also have more lines of evidence (in the form of historical maps and records) that you need to bring in to your analysis.  Work on the report has been slow-going because I often am too busy with other things to get a chance to work on it.The Day BeginsMy first task upon getting to the office–after brewing a pot of tea, of course–is to check in with our people in the field.  Today we have two field projects going on, both of which are in the monitoring stage.  “Monitoring” means that an archaeologist watches the construction crew as they dig, in order to spot any emerging resources (artifacts/sites/etc.) before they’re damaged or destroyed.  Monitoring is usually done after we’ve already done testing and evaluation of anything we know is on site, and is largely a failsafe to protect things we didn’t know were there.Of our two monitoring projects today, one is a big housing development at the outskirts of a suburban area, which had previously been ranchland, so the developer has had to do a lot of digging in order to install utilities and level the ground.  We’ve had one or two monitors out at that site almost every day for over a year.The other monitoring project is in an urban area; they’re digging down pretty deep because the building they’re working on will have an underground parking garage.  When we did our testing out there, we found lots of foundations and trash deposits dating to around 1850-1900.  Since they were so extensive–covering almost all of the lot–it was inefficient to try to expose them all before construction started.  So, with an idea of where the interesting stuff is, we’re letting the construction crew do their digging (with a monitor watching) and when they get close to a resource we bring in a team to excavate and record it.Pieces of “diagnostic” ceramics from a site. These particular ones were manufactured in England and imported here to the U.S. in the late 1800s.I also check in with the people who are working in the office/lab today.  Our osteologist and one of our summer interns are working on mortuary analysis for human remains from a historic cemetery that had to be removed recently; a senior archaeologist is analyzing and writing up artifacts from an 1840s-1850s site; and a lab tech is sorting through tiny bits of rubble from wetscreening.  The rubble is what’s left after you wash away the dirt and take out the big/visible artifacts, but can contain important things like beads, little rodent bones, and bits of worked stone.  On a typical day this week we also had a senior archaeologist working on a testing plan, another archaeologist analyzing wood beams from a site, our other summer intern refitting and identifying ceramics using the Transferware Pattern Database, and two or three lab techs working on the wetscreening rubble.  However, this is the weekend before the Independence Day holiday in the United States, and a bunch of people have taken the day off.The Business-y StuffOnce I’d confirmed that everyone was where they were supposed to be and had everything they needed, it was time to check email and see what happened overnight.  Two potential clients have asked us to prepare proposals to do work for them.  One proposal is for a client we work with a lot, involving utility replacement.  I get together a map of the utility alignment, a description of the archaeological requirements for that jurisdiction, and the final budget and report from another project we completed a couple years ago for the same client in the same utility district.  I give all these things to the Principal Investigator, who’ll come up with a scope of work and budget for the client to approve.The other proposal is for an on-call contract with a public agency.  Rather than have to go through a months-long process of soliciting bids, evaluating them, putting them up for public comment, selecting a preferred vendor, negotiating costs, etc., every time they need work done, most public agencies will set up multi-year on-call contracts.  They just have to go through the process once, and then when something comes up they just go to their on-call archaeologist (or whatever) and say “We need you to do this job, and we’ve already got your rates, so go do it.”  Oftentimes for archaeology, nothing will come up during the on-call period, so getting an on-call contract doesn’t mean you’re necessarily going to actually get any billable work.  Since for this proposal we’re working as a team with other companies–an architectural historian, a development specialist, an environmental firm, and an engineer–our portion of the proposal is pretty small.  I give our office manager a list of similar projects we’ve worked on, hourly rates, resumes, and references, and she’ll format them to match the materials from the other companies and then send them on.The Archaeology StuffWith business matters taken care of, it’s time for me to put on my archaeologist hat.  One of our senior archaeologists has been working on a testing plan for a project near the waterfront.  Sites near the water have different kinds of resources than inland sites–especially in places like here, where the current waterfront area used to be underwater before people filled it in.  The city’s Planning Department records all known and expected maritime resources–like ships and wharves–in a GIS database, portions of which they make available to archaeologists working in the area.  An email arrives from Planning with a screenshot of what they think is in our project area, and it turns out there are more ships than we thought there were.  The archaeologist who’s got the lead on this project is one of the ones who took the day off, so after a quick flurry of emails and texts to Planning, the absent archaeologist, and our maritime archaeologist consultant, I rewrite a portion of the testing plan for her and send the new version to the maritime archaeologist for review.  Our clients for this project have tried to design their project around the anticipated ships so they won’t disturb them, so they’re not going to be happy to hear that there are probably more.  We won’t know until we go out and test, though, so no point in redesigning their project again just yet.The PrivyThis feature, from a site we excavated in 2009, was originally built as a well. After the well silted up and was abandoned, it was used as a privy. The feature was pretty stinky.Lunchtime comes and goes, but is cut short by a phone call–our monitor at the urban site has found a privy.  Privies, or “outhouses” in modern American vernacular, are a great source of information about the people who used them because, before  municipal trash collection, all sorts of things used to get thrown down them.  And since the pits are usually relatively narrow, everything stacks up quickly, so there’s often a clear stratigraphic difference between a broken plate thrown down in one year and an empty medicine bottle thrown down the next.  That means we can pinpoint dates easily.  The downside to excavating privies is that, depending on soil conditions and age, they can smell absolutely disgusting.  Our monitor found this one by smell rather than sight.  Unpleasant for her, but on the other hand she caught it so early that it wasn’t damaged by the excavation equipment at all.I check with our Principal Investigator, who decides that we should leave it in place until Monday.  We’re short on hands today, so we don’t have anyone free to go out and help the monitor excavate it; plus, it’s near the end of the day for the construction crew (who usually work 7am-3pm).  The monitor directs the construction crew to work on another part of the site, and covers up the privy to protect it–and anybody who might venture on site and fall into it–over the weekend.The Publicity ProblemLeaving the privy over the weekend is a gamble, though.  Our monitor has witnessed fresh potholes on site when she arrives in the mornings–bottle hunters have been breaking into the site overnight, digging holes, and stealing artifacts before we have a chance to find and record them properly.  This, despite the fact that the construction site has an overnight security guard.   This isn’t at all an unusual situation, and is why professional archaeologists have to be careful about what information we publicize.  We would all like to involve the public in our work–it’s fascinating, and belongs to everyone in our community–but if we tell the news crews that we’re working on an awesome site, we’ll come back the next day to find the whole place looted.  In the United States, archaeological information is privileged.  The National Register of Historic Places will tell you the address of every historic bridge, house, and monument, but the locations of sites are confidential.  Similarly, when developers submit their technical studies to planning departments for public review, the archaeological maps are omitted.  There’s just too much danger that a site will be damaged or destroyed if its location is made public.So.  What to do about this privy?  We don’t trust the on-site security to keep it safe, since they haven’t done a terribly good job of protecting the archaeology so far (their primary task is to protect the equipment and materials, and on this site the “security” consists of someone driving by every once in a while and seeing if anything looks amiss).  Our usual strategy is to cover it up with a board or tarp, bury it, and park a piece of heavy equipment over it.  No go–since it was found at the end of the day, by the time we were ready to cover it up, the construction crew had all gone home.  The Principal Investigator emails the developer to let them know that the privy exists and is potentially in danger.The Plan of ActionThe developer calls a couple of hours later to discuss strategy for the privy.  It turns out he’s got three different companies scheduled to be working on site on Monday, and there won’t be space for all of them to do their jobs with the privy there.  So he asks us if we can get a crew together to excavate it tomorrow–which is Saturday, and therefore overtime.  Now, at this point it’s 4:30pm on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend, so getting a crew together is problematic.  I check with everyone still in the office: no luck.  I call all of our regular crew: one person can work all day and one can work a half-day.  I call all of our on-call crew, who bounce around from job to job (a.k.a. “digbums” or “shovelbums“): no luck.  Everyone’s either working for someone else, or out of town for the weekend, or entertaining guests.  Two hours of phone calls and texts later, all I can come up with is 2.5 people, with the possibility of one more who’s not answering her phone.  That’s enough to get a decent amount of work done, so I call the developer to let him know we’ll be on site at 7am tomorrow morning. Then, after confirming start time with each of the crew, I spend another hour collecting field gear and printing field forms.Finally, well into Friday evening, I’m ready to shut down the computer and go home.I never did get around to editing that report.The The Business of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"372","Good morning from Berlin! We are finally getting a bit of sun….which we need given the Euro2012 match results last night (Glückwunsch an Spanien und Italien!). So — since my Day of Archaeology post last year, I’ve started a Marie Curie COFUND fellowship at Freie Universität Berlin, in association with the Dahlem Research School and TOPOI. My research project is entitled:  A Comparative Study of Scribal and Artistic Spaces in Early Egypt and the Ancient Near East: Integrating micro- and macro-scale analyses. More information can be found here and I am also keeping a blog on my progress. (In fact, in addition to posting here I really need to update said blog, but that will probably happen Monday now since today is already chock full!)So here is a bit about what I am getting up to today. I am in the course of planning several museum research visits for this summer. I need to document 100 ancient art- and writing-bearing objects dating to the early period of graphical development (c.3200-c.2500 BCE) in both southern Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley. I am documenting and examining both portable objects (e.g. cylinder seals, impressed sealings, cuneiform tablets, labels) and fixed image-bearing surfaces (e.g. stelae, tomb relief, rock art), using Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI).Stone tablet with early writing incised into its surfact, University of Pennsylvania Museum, B16105Although I am an Egyptologist first and foremost, I did dabble a bit in Near Eastern archaeology and languages (e.g. Akkadian) as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. With this project I am finally getting back to this side interest which is quite exciting. But it means coordinating museum research with both the Egyptian and Near Eastern curators and other staff at each museum. This morning my goal is to get my object list and research permission request sent off the the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology before lunch.Dahlem Research SchoolThis afternoon several other post-docs and I will be participating in a peer coaching session at the Dahlem Research School, with the help of a successful grant applicant, on drafts proposals for funding we’ve been preparing for a follow-on research projects. My COFUND fellowship is for 15 months, and in addition to completing a research project this year, I am tasked with bringing in funding for a follow project (Note: details for the next COFUND application should be posted soon at link above. Do consider applying!).It’s great to be in a fellowship programme that is emphatically about training and career development. Many fellowships / post-docs focus resources on completing of a particular piece of research. Fair enough I suppose, but having more advice, time and support thrown in my direction to help ensure the next gig is lined up is great. The level of regular contact, mentoring and–yes–deadlines that the DRS provide both for achieving our short-term goals and hammering out a longer-term career plan and getting it funded is super valuable. I need to take even more advantage of this in fact.Anyway, I’d best finish sorting out this museum object request list and reading my colleagues’ funding proposals for our peer review session.The Museum Archaeology Prep and a Bit of Gold Digging by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"373","Earlier today, I mentioned that one of the nice things about digital work was that, well, I could timeshift as necessary. So now, with kids in bed, and a quiet moment, I return to another project of mine that I’ve been working on since January – Looted Heritage. This isn’t funded, or part of anything larger – just one guy and some students, as time and energy allow. I started this project partly as an exercise in some of my classes, but partly out of an interest in the shady side of the interest in the human past – the market for illicit antiquities. By some counts, it’s the third largest black market out there, after drugs and guns. With Looted Heritage, we use the Ushahidi platform to grab and monitor tweets, blogs, news aggregators, and various social media streams for notices of looting, cultural heritage vandalism, or other items of interest. We turn these into reports, and pin them to the map. Periodically, we download all of this information (and you can too!) and mine this data for trends in this market.  There’s an ios and android app available too, so if one happened across a field where tombaroli were active, you could snap a pic and send it to us.We’ve already written up our results from the first quarter of 2012 here; our data is all there too if you’d like to explore it. If you’d like to keep an eye out for anything happening in the illicit antiquities market, it’d be great if you could submit reports on Looted Heritage. They say ‘many eyes make for better code’; many eyes can also help bring the illicit trade into the light.You should also take a look at WikiLoot and Loot Busters, who are working with more of the primary materials related to this trade.

"374","Another Day of Archaeology, and another year in which I’m not doing anything “sexy.” Well, last year I was on vacation, sitting in a baby pool on my back porch drinking beer, which may be sexy depending on your perspective…It’s often said that for every day in the field, there’s 5/7/X+>1 days of post-field reporting and analysis (and pre-field too, but I don’t recall that being part of the truism). Which means that you pay a big price for a little fun (again, depending on your perspective)(also, I make a lot of parenthetical comments, so be advised).Site recording, evaluation, and reporting is the most critical things that CRM archaeologists do. We are being paid by a client to look for cultural resources prior to construction of a project. If we find a site, we have to document it and determine what the significance of the site is. We then report this information to the client to help with their construction plans, and to permitting agencies to decide whether our evaluation is valid in their eyes. The recommendation could be (among others, but most common) no further work, avoidance, or additional archaeological investigation, ie: “digging”.We also submit a site record and map to the designated repository/agency, which in Texas is the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, or TARL. Theoretically, every site recorded in Texas should have a site form and map submitted to TARL, which can be accessed by other archaeologists as needed. They also maintain an online Atlas to help with planning work (click here to see a public version with certain Historic Sites). The Atlas has maps with locations of every recorded site, and links to the site data (when submitted).The information on the site form includes project information, locational data, natural setting data, observed components (ie 19th century, Late Paleoindian, unknown prehistoric), artifacts and features present at the site and their locations within the site, a description of the site, an assessment of the significance of the site, and a recommendation on the need for further work and eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (or in Texas as a State Archeological Landmark). This information should be thorough, to aid future archaeologists who may be working around that site.So…all that background is to explain why I did nothing today but sit at my desk, writing out information in little blanks with a pencil (which will then be entered into a computerized database for submission, which shows that we’re not quite 21st century here yet), peering at notes and maps on a screen, and then finding my “prehistoric not eligible” site write-up template to change a few words here and there for the report.I’ve been doing this on and off for the last month for this project, and many, many times over the last 4-5 years. It’s pretty boring, but it’s an important part of the archaeological process that is often given short shrift.If you’ve made it this far, your reward is some links to far more interesting days in my life as an archaeologist!My recent Juneteenth postPosts about metal detector survey at the Fannin Battleground State Historic SiteTwo parter about the Naked Flag LadyPossibly the best day everand Part 1 and Part 2 of my rattlesnake bite adventure.Happy Day of Archaeology, y’all!  The Site recording and reporting by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"375","Carole Nash writing to you from Virginia’s beautiful Shenandoah Valley, where I’m finishing up a week-long field school at a ca. 1760 Rhenish stone flurkuchenhaus, the White House, on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River.  I teach at James Madison University in Harrisonburg and co-direct the Archaeological Technician Certification Program, an effort of the Archeological Society of Virginia, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, and the Council of Virginia Archaeologists.  This week’s field school was created for Cert students — we have over 70 grads and almost 90 active students who commit to 60 hours of lab work, 60 hours of field survey, 60 hours of excavation, 20 hours of public education, 12 courses, and a reading list a mile long.  Our students range in age from 16-83 and all share a remarkable dedication to archaeology.  The White House field school is but one of our 2012 Cert programs.What started as a very clear, cool week ended with a blast of summer — today’s temps reached 100 degrees at the site — and we have one more day to go.  Anyone who has spent a summer digging in Virginia knows what this means:  start early, drink lots of water, and take a LONG lunch!  Fortunately for us, we’re working in an amazingly beautiful location in the shadow of Massanutten Mountain, we have shade trees and canopies, and we have a clean portajohn.  We have an outdoor lab set up to wash artifacts.  Actually feels pretty luxurious.So….the White House:  built by a German immigrant family in ca. 1760; now part of the White House Farm Foundation, which has put 270 acres of land in conservation easement and is working toward a National Register nomination for the structure.  A flurkuchenhaus is a Rhenish (German Rhineland) design, with three rooms downstairs and two rooms upstairs, plus a vaulted basement.  They are sometimes referred to as ‘stone forts’ because they were constructed during the French and Indian War years on the Virginia Frontier, but they were not defensive structures.  They’re beautiful stone houses, though.  This one was covered with skim and stucco at least three times.  We have been reading Valley documents and know that the house was called “White House” as early as 1769 and used as a Mennonite and Baptist meeting house.Our goals (in addition to getting our students solid archaeological training):  confirm the date of construction; learn about the evolution of the house; determine the impact of flooding on the landform (first terrace, South Fork of the Shenandoah); and learn whether the terrace was occupied by Native Americans prior to the Kauffman family.  A tall order for a week of work!  Gotta aim high, right?  We did, indeed, find evidence to assist with each of these goals, although admittedly, the heat slowed us down today.I am so proud of our team — today’s crew included six Certification grads (Laura Wedin, Marsha Summerson, Maxine Grabill, Janice Biller, Linda Waggy, and Kay Veith), a Certification student (Philip Mulford), our local ASV Chapter President (Cindy Schroer), and a new archaeology student (Cullen Byers).  Our smaller crew today was down from 18 on Wednesday.  GO TEAM!  You’re the best!Our findings from thirteen 2.5′ x 2.5 units and one backhoe trench:  our arms aren’t long enough to dig on the South Fork floodplain!  We have a .4′ flood deposit on top of a 1′ plowzone filled with late 18th/19th century artifacts, with Native American lithics and pottery included.  Under the plowzone we have flood deposit 1, flood deposit 2, flood deposit 3, flood deposit 4, flood deposit 5 — and that’s where we stopped.  The bucket auger is our friend.Cool artifacts:  a piece of eight from the reign of Charles III (Carolus dollar); two French gun flints; English brown stoneware; Westerwald stoneware; a kaolin pipestem; creamware; a remarkable variety of pearlware; cut nails and more cut nails; Middle and Late Woodland pottery.Our plan:  come back in the Fall when the weather is cooler.Happy Day of Archaeology from Virginia, all!East wall of White House The 100 Degrees, High Humidity — Field School in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"376","Every day in the Council for British Archaeology is different. Every day throws up new challenges, whilst offering new opportunities.As Director of the CBA a brief diary of today runs as follows:start the day by buying the Yorkshire Post on my way to work as I am featured today as part of the promotion for the 2012 Festival of British Archaeology. Quickly skim the article and experience relief that it comes across positively, though there are some relatively minor errors. The Festival is the CBA’s major flagship annual event with nearly 800 separate activities taking place this year across the UK. The PR agency is doing a good job to promote the Festival and there will be more media interviews to come in the next few weeks.first meeting of the day with colleagues to discuss the next stage of development with various information services that the CBA runs, including the Training Online Resource Centre. We are hoping to integrate our various information services more closely in the coming years to provide better value-added services for users to enable them to access information about archaeology more easily.after a quick trip to the opticians for an eye test, it is back to office to meet with a prospective volunteer who wants to help the CBA and gain confidence and experience to help them back into the workplace. It is good to talk to anyone who is passionate about archaeology and we are able to explore a number of options which may suit. I’ll follow that up later in the day with colleagues to see what we can offer. Volunteers play a key role in the work of the CBA and there are a number of ways in which people can engage with our work.time to catch up with the morning’s emails from a diverse range of internal and external colleagues. Key issues include following up on a meeting the previous day in London to discuss setting up a major new public participation project to identify and record physical remains in the UK which relate to World War 1, and also work on a new digital platform to promote the work of the CBA which we are hoping to launch in time for the Festival in July.working lunch with a colleague from English Heritage who is in York for a meeting at the University, with skills and training as the main topics for discussion. The Federation of Archaeological Managers and Employers is hosting a meeting on the topic in York next month and there is going to be a focus on training in the 2013 Heritage Counts in England, with a new round of the Profiling the Profession just starting up to gather data on everyone working in archaeology at the current time. Inevitably these are crucial issues at the present time with the ongoing reduction in public funding for  archaeology and the consequent drop in jobs and loss of skills.back from lunch and straight into a meeting with a colleague who will be leaving the CBA within a month to plan the best use of her remaining time and the transition to new staffing arrangements. The CBA has had a lot of staffing changes in the last six months, some due to redundancy and many due to colleagues moving on to pastures new. The latest departures provide further opportunities for restructuring to ensure that we have the skills and experience that we need to take our plans forward. Membership is a key issue for the CBA at the present time as by growing the membership we can broaden our public education role, strengthen our advocacy and achieve a more secure financial base. I hope that everyone reading this will consider joining the CBA if they are not already signed up!brief chat about how we can celebrate the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the Young Archaeologists’ Club (which started as Young Rescue in 1972). It would be nice to do something but staff resources are stretched.time to plan for the weekend and yet more proof that archaeologists never stop as I’m off down south on a ‘secret mission’ linked with my role as Chair of the British Archaeological Awards. Our major awards ceremony is coming up and will include a number of surprises but all will be revealed at the British Museum on 9 July!back to the emails (which also never stop!) and my never-ending battle to end the week with a clean in-tray (no chance this week!)more planning for the CBA weekend event in mid September to follow upon a visit earlier in the week to some of the sites which we are including. I’m going to try to visit the only site we didn’t see on my way down south tomorrow. It should be a fantastic weekend in September as we take two full coach-loads of archaeology enthusiasts to visit Buxton, the prehistoric landscape of Stanton Moor, the amazing industrial archaeology of Masson Mill, the medieval castle at Bolsover and the palaeolithic archaeology of Creswell Crags.last task of the day is to catch up with other staff colleagues about the outcome of various discussions that took place during the day. The pace of work these days never seems to allow enough time to talk to everyone. I’m tempted to encourage people to go to  the pub to celebrate a successful Day of Archaeology but I need to be home to take my son to scout camp!later I resume engagement with the week’s emails and finally sum up the day in this blog post.Another varied day in the CBA promoting ‘archaeology for all’.Mike Heyworth The Archaeology for all by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"377","A shot of where I spent my dayThis year my Day of Archaeology is quite different from last year (http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/digging-with-kids-historic-archaeology-education-and-fun/).  I have recently begun a new career as a Transportation Planner in the Office of Environmental Review at the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CT DOT).  My education and background in archaeology are what allow me to do preliminary project reviews for impacts to historic and cultural resources.  At the CT DOT, projects can vary from line painting on a road, to bridge replacement, to major infrastructure construction.  What I do day-to-day changes and it certainly keeps the job interesting.  Outside of work I also have other commitments of an archaeological nature.  I am on the Board of Directors for the Friends of the Office of State Archaeology (FOSA), and I also volunteer my time running public archaeological excavations for local museums.  A lot of my “free” time is used organizing events.Here is a general schedule of what my day looked like today:6:15-6:45AM: While eating breakfast I spent time searching for organization contact information to solicit participants for FOSA’s Public Archaeology Fair, which will be held Oct. 27th 2012 in Wethersfield, CT.7:00-7:30AM: While commuting to work I listened to The Archaeology Channel’s podcast (http://www.archaeologychannel.org/AudioNews.asp).7:30-9:00AM: At the office I organized site maps and photos and filled out archaeology site forms to be submitted to the CT State Historic Preservation Office (CT SHPO) and CT State Archaeologist in order to get site numbers for two historic bridge and mill sites (in Plymouth and Woodbury) that were identified while out on a bridge survey last month.  This site information will eventually be added to the database of CT archaeological sites maintained by the CT SHPO and CT State Archaeologist.  This information is used by state officials for planning purposes and by CRM firms for research purposes.9:00-11:00AM: I organized project information, maps, and recommendations to submit to the CT SHPO for review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Connecticut Environmental Policy Act (CEPA).11:00AM-4:00PM: I reviewed 4 new projects for impacts to socio-economic resources, parks, refuges, scenic roads and bikeways.  (My job actually entails investigating impacts beyond cultural resources under NEPA & CEPA.)  These projects included bridge replacements and roadway and utility improvements.5:00-6:00PM: Sent e-mails asking (begging & pleading) local archaeology and historical groups to participate in FOSA’s Public Archaeology Fair, sent out a rough draft of an advertising blurb for the event, and sent my FOSA Archaeology Awareness Month Committee an update.That just about sums up my day.  Suffice it to say, much of my day revolves around archaeology in some way, even though I spend less and less time in the dirt. The A Day in Transportation Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"378","It’s not that I don’t like my job. It’s just that the cool, refreshing feeling of an icy cold beer sliding down my throat hole at the end of another work week is so inviting. So, I spend my Friday’s dreaming of the time when a beer will be in my hand. This Friday is particularly uninteresting. Busy, but highly uninteresting. It’s so unbelievably hot outside for Flagstaff AZ that everyone is starting to go nuts waiting for the monsoon rains to come cool off our summer days. A few of us (those silly specialized kind) are stuck inside in front of a computer, clicking away all day long. Click, click, bloody click. It used to be fun being the technical person, the one that could always make the computer, device, or program work. The geeky side of things lacks its allure when you are forbidden to leave the office all year long. Map after map, edit after edit, week after week. There is no walking, no digging, no playing in the sun for this GIS Manager. There is only the glow of my monitor, the occasional whir of the hard drive, and that incessant clicking!The only bonus to being the archy computer rat is that BEER:30 generally comes early.

"379","When I wrote last year’s post I had the feeling that my life was not as exciting as others. This year I kind of confirm it, but at least, once again, I think I’ve been doing different, normal stuff. So, what was my day today?I still keep my company open, but one month ago I had to leave the office to adjust expenses. Today is the day I finished moving! I now have internet again and air conditioning (at home, my new office for the moment). For that, I was the whole morning with the technician talking about all the shit in the world… even the world of archaeology. Furniture from former JAS Arqueología’s office stored in my village… I also had to attend a couple of clients from the editorial and run to my parents’ home to prepare lunch and take care of my grandad. Meanwhile, my partners from AMTTA (contribution soon online too) were presenting out latest project; ‘Combates por la Historia’ (Combats for History), to show and socialize hidden and destroyed heritage in Madrid through different routes, the first one, Campus de Batalla (Battle Campus) about the Civil War front in Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid.Anyway, the afternoon was a bit more archaeological… After lunch I continued editing the next book from my editorial, the second by Riccardo Frigoli. A great essay on archaeology, interpretation and communication. But it was not for long, as I had to attend the second event with AMTTA, the general annual meeting of Madrid Ciudadanía y Patrimonio, an association we joined to continue fighting for heritage. And after that a round table about Heritage and the Crisis. During the round table The round table was quite interesting, as we mostly talked about two important issues:-The crisis: Not only economic, but moral. How besides the economic difficulties, heritage was always in the middle of a general disinterest that was harmful for heritage.-The new law projected in Madrid for Historical Heritage: Suddenly, maybe due to the possibility of hosting Eurovegas, the regional government has written a draft for a new law that is negligent and goes against any principle we might share as professionals.[If fluent in Spanish, see the text and our comments here]Now I came back home, I had some chinese for dinner and am writing this. The day is over and this time I’m not traveling anywhere soon, so every day this week will be pretty similar, pretty boring.btw I’m Jaime Almansa-Sánchez The Such a boring life… or not, just normal by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"380","Today, like almost every day between May and September this year I’ve been working on my MSc research Project. Instead of just explaining what I’ve been doing today i thought it would be more interesting to describe what is going into my individual research project.I’m experimented with a new novel way of collecting electrical resistivity tomography data  with a zzGeo FlashRes64 which as you might expect involves a significant amount of lab and field data collection.To allow inversion of these novel techniques far too much of my time has been devoted to developing software to allow analysis of the data, and investigation of different visualisation techniques. Though  it does make a nice change from the driving rain outside.Before going out in the snow and rain its important to know that the data collected will be as good as possible. This means i spend a lot of time visualising different data collection techniques as point clouds as below. I promise they end up being quite relaxing.Eventually after determining the best collection strategy, standing out in the rain and the cold for hours, extracting, converting and comparing data you do end up with a decent representation of whats beneath the surface. P.S You should be able to zoom and play with the images above.

"381","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in flight.Image © Callen LenzWell, firstly, I can’t believe it’s been a year since last time! Doesn’t time fly? What’s happened since then I hear you cry? I’m still the Geomatics Manager for Wessex Archaeology, responsible for GIS and Survey. The big news is my desk is now paper free and I’m trying to keep to a paperless work regime, essential seeing as most of my workspace is taken up with computer equipment, leaving no room for unnecessary clutter. In the photo you can see not only my laptop but the recently rebuilt GISBEAST machine with it’s quad cores, 64-bit OS and 12Gb RAM, tooled up with all the software I need to do what I do.My shiny workplaceIt’s true, the closest I have come to excavation this year was indeed going through the stratigraphic deposits that had taken over my desk but that’s not to say what I do isn’t archaeology, it’s just digital archaeology. And the survey work in particular gets me out of the office, not being office bound being one of the main reasons for my becoming an archaeologist in the first place… Thank goodness for the rapid and ever improving world of mobile computing and access to high speed mobile data is all I can say!As with my post from last year, my day didn’t quite turn out as planned, but was interesting nonetheless and completely office bound, tied to my computers. I have a number of projects on the go at the moment, all of which are on the brink of completion, so my aim was to collate some figures and statistics relating to monument data for a stretch of the south coast from Kent round to the New Forest then get onto some cartography, figure production and report writing. To produce the figures, I needed to build some SQL Queries and undertake some spatial queries for a large amount of Historic Environment Record data. Probably not the most exciting thing to be doing on a Friday morning, especially not for the Day of Archaeology, but when you specialise in GIS, databases, spatial technologies and heritage data management, there is often quite a lot of nuts and bolts graft to be done to make sense of the archaeological record.Volunteers learning to use a Total Station Theodolite (TST) at St Georges Church, PortlandImage © Wessex ArchaeologyHowever, of more interest, a chunk of this morning was spent finalising a project website, pretty much completed yesterday but needing some final amendments before being pushed to a wider audience today. I was also finalising fieldwork arrangements and prepping social media channels for the same geomatics and outreach project taking place in July for the Festival of British Archaeology. I’m really looking forward to this one as it has some really good use of technology at its core, including some amazing aerial survey work using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, plus some spatial analysis and metric survey including Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS); pretty much my favourite activities all in one project. It also includes a geophysical survey component so one of the aims is to look at the multiple layers of data and subject them to multivariate statistical analysis.Laser Scanning.Image © Paul CrippsAnother part of my day was then spent looking at some rock art which was recently recorded by laser scanning. The data from this has been visualised in a number of ways to get the most detail out of it. This was very much a team effort and full credit is due to those who contributed: Chris Breeden and Chris Swales (processing and registration of the scan data), Karen Nichols (virtual RTI), Ken Lymer (rock art guru) and me (project management, spatial analysis and visualisation). After registration and processing of the data, we output a Digital Surface Model (DSM) as a mesh and used this to produce a virtual Reflectance Transformation Image (RTI), through which we could move the light source around and investigate the surface detail and any rock art present. This technique was pioneered at Wessex Archaeology for use on virtual objects at any scale from flints to landscapes by Tom Goskar. As part of the spatial analysis, I then took the DSM and normalised it by elevation (after Doneus & Briese, 2006) to enhance the surface features. I also took the RTI data and produced a Principal Components Analysis (after Devereux et al, 2008). And of course, the usual GIS based derived products were used including Slope maps and roving statistical windows to enhance local views using local statistics on particular areas of rock art.LiDAR profile over some prehistoric burial moundsImage © Wessex ArchaeologyIn between times, I had a quick look at an upcoming project for which we will need some detailed topographic data. One option is to purchase LiDAR from the Environment Agency but unfortunately they do not have hi-res data, only 2m resolution data which is problematic for archaeological work (see Crutchley, 2010). This is a shame as the EA LiDAR catalogue is a very cost effective way of procuring good quality topographic data. So looks like I’ll be helping to specify and cost alternatives, all part of the service, and I have a number of options up my sleeve.Reflectance Transformation Imaging underway at St George’s, Portland.Image © Nicole BealeAnd finally, I set up some animation paths ready to render some visualisations of another laser scanning project. This project was undertaken in two phases, the first is completed already and the second about to be so. The overall project involved a metric survey of the churchyard including training/outreach activities and involvement from Operation Nightingale plus laser scanning of key monuments, a complete photographic inventory and some Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), undertaken by the Re-reading the British Memorial project team. Oh, and we also did some panoramic photography since the churchyard is so beautiful and used some of the gravestones to gather some test data for ongoing R&D into the application of automated photogrammetry; we now have the same monuments recorded using a number of photogrammetric systems, a Faro scanner and a Leica scanner for comparison. The bit I’m working on at the moment relates to pointclouds captured of some of the larger monuments, the aim being to produce some informative visualisations for now but the data also forms a robust baseline for future monitoring and conservation.So that was it for my day of archaeology other than various meetings, briefings and other purely business stuff. And of course then getting home and putting the finishing touches to my CAA papers and doing a bit more blogging and social media to promote the St Andrew’s, Holcombe project (bookings are now being taken for the participatory events, so get in quick, and no bookings required for the Saturday open lecture/talk events; plus they’re all free and fun!). For those who do want to come to Holcombe, there’s a map below to show the way, produced quickly and easily using GoogleMaps and some basic HTML.I must also admit to spending a bit of time looking at some of the posts already up on the Day of Archaeology website and being impressed with the breadth and depth of content, not to mention the sheer volume of contributions this year.

"382","Its 30min past Day of Archaeology here in Estonia, so not too late to post my thoughts from the day.I was sitting in my office in Tallinn, working with the dataset from Hungary for the University of Southampton and thinking about the TED’s talk I went to see day before (over live link from Edinburgh) about the globalisation and openness. Pankaj Ghemawat told us that when looking the data, there is actually no globalisation, or at least not at the level we’d like to think about it. He encouraged us to look for our own answers based on the data.And here I am, working with the database gathered over half a dozen years or more. Main question I struggle with is how my work (merging and preparing  datasets for analyses) might change the end results… and how the people who are going to analyse the data trust someone like me to play with it and to make it “eatable” for them?I do not agree with Pankaj about the globalisation, but i do think we need to know the data we draw our conclusions from much better, or even if we help someone else do it.The Globalisation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"383","Today, June 29th, is the second annual Day of Archaeology, and we are proud to be a part of this project again! You can also see last year’s post here: A Day in the Life of the Michigan State University Campus Archaeology Program.This summer, the Michigan State University (MSU) Campus Archaeology Program (CAP) has been busy trying to keep ahead of the massive construction plans on campus, surveying and testing areas prior to any demolition or excavation. Every week since April has consisted of surveys of large portions of MSU’s historic campus. We’ve even been excavating beneath sidewalks as they are removed and behind fences. This involves not only a lot of physical work, but also constant communication with the construction companies and broader MSU community. All of our work is discussed on our blog, and we have live from-the-field tweets. Our goal in excavating on campus is two-fold: to mitigate and protect the historic and prehistoric landscape at MSU, and to educate the campus and broader community about the importance of archaeology. We also use the program as a way to train students. Our team of summer archaeologists includes both graduate and undergraduate students from MSU who survey, excavate, conduct lab work, interpret materials, and do archival research.This past week we hosted a group of grandparents and grandkids for MSU’s Grandparent’s University. On Tuesday, we gave lectures about who we are and what we do, followed by a tour of the historic campus that included a stop at one of our ongoing excavation projects. This unit was put in after extensive survey in this area. We found historic clay pipes and a layer of broken brick in a number of shovel test pits, so we opened up a unit in between these pits to further investigate what these artifacts may represent. On Wednesday, the kids and grandparents were able to have hands-on time examining ceramics, glass and other artifacts found by our archaeologists. They also were able to make some of their own artifacts by using clay and an assortment of tools to decorate their objects. Here’s a picture of some of the Grandparents U students on our walking tour. We always enjoy these programs because we get the opportunity to teach both grandparents & kids at the same time!Comments by Lynne Goldstein, Director of CAPAlthough a lot of the work of Campus Archaeology is in the field, we do a whole lot of work in the lab and in archives as well. In order to properly understand and interpret what we find, we need to know what kind of information is available about the site or area. Have other archaeologists worked here? Were there buildings here? Did other activities happen here? Before we go out into the field, we do archival research to help us learn as much as we possibly can about the area we are about to explore. That way, we have a better idea of what we might find. Our archival work is both on campus and with the State Archaeologist’s Office, as well as in the Library and online.As of today, we are mostly done with our fieldwork for the summer. Now is the time we spend in our lab, processing and interpreting our findings. It isn’t always as dramatic as digging, but it can still be exciting. Plus, it always makes us happy when we can post our reports.The Excavating Michigan State University with the Campus Archaeology Program by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The area is a rich source of prehistoric and historic Maori sites, plus pioneer European gold mining, timber milling and farming sites. I’m currently searching for a pioneer farm block that was allocated in 1880, subjected to bush clearance, and farmed for some 20-30 years, until it was finally abandoned. The block of interest is the 240 acres allocated to Richard Taylor in the Karaka Valley, about 10 km inland from Thames. Historical evidence indicates he engaged in dairy farming, and transported his produce down to Thames, by packhorse.We now have an old survey map of the boundaries of Taylor’s Farm, and some historical info on where the homestead was. The area is now covered in dense re-growth bush and is particularly difficult to traverse, away from the few main foot tracks in the area.On Day of Archaeology (29th June) we searched for Taylor’s homestead site, plus other farm features (e.g. fences). We have found a dwelling site, with remains of machinery consistent with a dairy farm (remains of a cream separator). However, this was slightly outside the recorded boundaries of Taylor’s block, so we’re not 100% sure if it was Taylor’s dwelling or not. If not, it’s still a significant site; being in the area known as Punga Flat, a mining settlement established in 1868.Best wishes to my NZAA colleagues, who are at the annual conference in Oamaru. Unfortunately, I wont be able to join them this year. The Taylor’s Farm (Pioneer Farm Settlement Site in Coromandel Ranges, NZ) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"385","I hadn’t planned for anything exciting today – but you never know what can happen. I had a new detectorist dropping in who recorded a Roman and a post medieval coin with me which was a nice surprise. The coins are recorded as LANCUM-D92224 (Roman denarius of Hadrian) and LANCUM-D8A9E3 (sixpence of Elizabeth I dating from 1572), both from Woodplumpton, Lancs. – it was very nice of the detectorist and his dad, the landowner, to think about recording their finds and I am glad that they somehow found their way to the PAS. I guess seven years ago when I started the job that would have been virtually impossible. Today, I am ‘part of the team’ for most of the detectorists in Lancashire and Cumbria.Last night, a new club was founded: the Furness Finders. They got in touch with me BEFORE the meeting and asked me which days I couldn’t attend the meetings. It’s great that they want to make sure that the local FLO records their finds and I was pleasantly surprised. That ups my club count from two to three club in North Lancashire and Cumbria. Barrow has proven to be fantastic place to find ‘stuff’ recently: We have had the Viking hoard from the Furness area, a Chinese coin hoard and lately, the first ever Early Iron Age hoard in the area – all discovered by local metal detectorists and all reported within hours/days of discovery. Makes me happy to have played part in this.Another nice surprise today was that one of my Cumbrian detectorists found an inscribed medieval spindle whorl (see image). I have no idea what it means, but I hope I will find out. I suspect it’s just non-sensical lettering, but wouldn’t it be great if it meant something? Unfortunately, I research Early Iron Age socketed axes, not medieval inscription, so all I could do was photoshop it and send it off to people who know more about medieval lettering than I do…Medieval lead-alloy inscribed spindle whorl from Great Mitton, Lancs.The An Inscribed Spindle Whorl by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"386","My name is Kurt Thomas Hunt.  I’m a CRM archaeologist based in New York State and I head up an archaeoblog called Sexy Archaeology.  Sexy Archaeology is one way that I provide public outreach within the field of archaeology by sharing the work that I do alongside what I consider excitingly appealing happenings from around the globe.  I’m also the president of the New York State Archaeological Association’s (NYSAA) Thousand Islands Chapter, one of sixteen Chapters within the Empire State.For this year’s Day of Archaeology, I’ve chosen to share a brief overview of the NYSAA’s history, highlight the work of my Chapter, and attempt to persuade those who are not already members to join their local archaeological Chapter or Society.The New York State Archaeological Association (NYSAA) is composed of professional and avocational archaeologists primarily within New York State (though residency is not a prerequisite to join). NYSAA exists to promote archaeological and historical study, and research covering the artifacts, rites, customs, beliefs and other phases of the lives and cultures of the American Indian occupants of New York State up to their contact with Europeans and beyond.The NYSAA was founded in 1916 and there are currently sixteen regional chapters of the NYSAA throughout the State. Each of the chapters holds monthly meetings where they present programs related to New York archaeology. Some of the chapters conduct their own fieldwork with the assistance of both members and volunteers.  The NYSAA also publishes a bulletin and journal and sponsors an annual meeting in the spring of each year.The Thousand Islands Chapter of the NYSAA was founded in 1994 and hosts over thirty members with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.Photo: Kurt Thomas HuntOur Chapter recently finished hosting a summer dig for its members along the shores of the Indian River, long known to be an essential byway for indigenous peoples through Northern New York.  While a complete understanding of the site is still a ways off, a rough interpretation dictates that the two-acre area was most likely a seasonal Iroquois occupation site.Photo: Kurt Thomas HuntThis rough interpretation is derived primarily from surface finds and excavations performed over the past couple of years.  During this year’s dig, 298 pieces of pottery were unearthed within the first five centimeters of a single 1m x 1m unit.  Other evidence has included flakes of locally sourced chert, projectile points, and just this year a post mold.Aside from fieldwork, the Thousand Islands Chapter has, in the past, hosted lectures and discussions from a wide range of professionals, organized tours of historical sites, and has provided educational outreach programs for both children and adults across several counties within Northern New York.Local or regional chapters of your state archaeological society provide exciting opportunities and come with numerous benefits.  Society’s allow the chance for professional individuals to network, avocational archaeologists to hone their craft, and students the opportunity to garner experience from more seasoned individuals.  Regional societies or chapters also afford members of the community the opportunity to better familiarize themselves with the history and archaeology of their area.I invite you to join your local Chapter and Society.  Not sure where to get started?  The AIA website is a great place to turn, but a simple Google search or an email to your State Historic Preservation Office will also help further your search.  Good luck, and make the most of it!The Societies, Chapters, and Clubs: Oh My! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"387","My name is Tom Goskar and I am one of the organisers of the Day of Archaeology, as well as being a freelance archaeologist who specialises in applying digital techniques to different aspects of the discipline. My day today has been rather mixed, but predictably involved being at the proverbial digital coalface of archaeology in two aspects.At 8am I checked my email to catch up with the behind-the-scenes talk between the eight organisers of the Day of Archaeology, and log into this website to begin moderating the posts that were by then flowing thick and fast. By 11am I had been on a Google Hangout with Pat and Jess, and we had re-jigged the homepage to make it easier to explore, as well as temporarily excluding posts from last year to highlight the new contributions. It looked much better afterwards. I have been dipping into the website on and off all day, making sure that posts looked good, and expanding and linking the occasional acronym to help readers know what they are. The DoA moderators have been hard at work in the engine room!In between, for a personal project I have been processing 3D data from a medieval cross close to where I live, here in Penzance, Cornwall, as well as helping to refurbish a soon-to-be-open digital arts space in the town centre.The Penzance Market Cross, made in the 11th century, is decorated and has many inscriptions. These are very eroded and most people do not notice them. Unless you happen to see the stone in just the right glancing sunlight, the sides of the cross appear to just have some panels of dots and a few lines, not much else. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Using photogrammetric techniques, I have been examining the cross to see if how well 3D capture techniques can enhance the inscriptions and decorations, with the aim of comparing my results with drawings made using traditional techniques (rubbings, chalking, torchlit photos).In the spirit of the Day of Archaeology, below is a working illustration showing the north east elevation of the Market Cross, which I produced for this blog post. In the centre of the image is the cross as the casual visitor may see it. To the left, the colour information has been removed (which can sometimes be distracting), leaving the shape of the stone artificially coloured grey, with a virtual light source moved to show some of the decoration. To the right, a Radiance Scaling shader has been applied, which colours concavities and convexities to help reveal details on the stone.Penzance Market Cross, captured in 3D with photogrammetry, and enhanced using digital filters. As you can see from the Radiance Scaling image to the right, there is definitely more going on than first meets the eye. The figure in the second panel from the top is clearly visible, as are the letters and glyphs in the lower two panels. As I type, I am processing a mesh with a much higher level of detail, and look forward to the results which will be ready in the early hours of tomorrow morning. Comparing the results to the accepted interpretations made by Professor Charles Thomas will be interesting, whether they differ or help to confirm what we already know.So, my Day of Archaeology has been a busy and varying one, and it’s not over yet. Time to publish this post, and return to the list of posts to publish some more from around the globe, so that we can all show to the world what archaeologists really get up to in our own words. I hope that it helps people today and in the future to understand just how exciting and relevant archaeology is to us all.You can follow my archaeology musings over at my blog Past Thinking.The Enhancing worn inscriptions and the Day of Archaeology 2012 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

An average day in Kent would be whacking the fill out of a ditch/half-sectioning a whole load of postholes and recording it all (filling in forms, doing scale drawings of the feature, and photographing it). The fiddly nature of our excavation strategy for these test pits means your speed is limited – something which is usually a problem for a project that is developer-funded as there is always a schedule and a budget to stick to. But this Early Mesolithic stuff deserves the time we’re spending on it, and it just means my ‘Day of Archaeology’ submission describes one of those rare days when you never really put your trowel down!The A Shovelbum Story: Commercial Excavation in Deepest Darkest Kent… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"389","I am the curator and archaeologist for the Lost City Museum, a small archaeology museum located in Overton, NV. The main focus of the museum is the Virgin River Branch of the Ancestral Puebloans (also known as the Anasazi) who lived at the archaeological site complex formally known as Pueblo Grande de Nevada, but more commonly referred to as the Lost City. The Lost City Museum has a collection of artifacts dating not only to the Ancestral Puebloans, but to the group that occupied southern Nevada after it was abandoned by the Ancestral Puebloans, the Southern Paiutes.As the curator of a small museum I have many different projects going at once, ranging from a rehousing project that is being funded through money to organizing special events at the museum. One of the projects I am currently working on is the analysis of the museum’s incised stone collection. The incised stones were collected from Clark County, NV, the southern-most county in Nevada. Incised stones are intriguing artifacts because archaeologists aren’t entirely sure of their prehistoric use. Some suggest that it is a form of portable rock art while others suggest they could have been used by shaman during rituals.Sometimes it feels like I don’t choose the projects I work on, they choose me. As I was rehousing the archaeology collection of the Lost City Museum I kept coming across more and more incised stones. I knew the museum had a couple dozen incised stones that were recently on display at the museum. It wasn’t until I went through all of the boxes in the collections storage areas that I realized the museum had over one hundred incised stones (this perfectly illustrates why I started the rehousing project; I never knew for sure what the museum had and what wasn’t stored in the correct place). Given the number of incised stones at the museum I felt that it was extremely important that I properly catalog and analyze the stones so that the information could be used by researchers in the future.My analysis of each incised stones consists of recording the dimensions of each stone and noting whether the stone is hand size or smaller (the majority of incised stones can be comfortably carried in a hand). Next I categorize the design present on the stones. A past researcher was helpful enough to come up with eight categories of incised stone designs: curvilinear, dendritic, circle, band, bisect, cross-hatch, anthropomorph, and no discernible design. An example of a curvilinear design can in seen in the included photograph. Next I determine the stone’s material type. A majority of the stones analyzed so far have been sandstone, a readily available stone in southern Nevada. Once I gather all of the data I will be able see the patterns present within the collection. I can then compare this information to the information already obtained from the analysis of other incised stone collection at Nevada State Museums and see if the Lost City Museum collection differs greatly from those collections.This is an ongoing project because as much as I would like to focus all of my time on the analysis of the incised stones, new projects or issues pop up on a daily or weekly basis. As the curator of a small museum I wear many hats, and I often have to put projects on hold while I research something for a fellow archaeologist or give a tour to a group of Girl Scouts. One great thing about being an archaeologist for a museum is that it is unlikely I will run out of research topics any time soon.The Curating a Small Archaeology Museum by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"390","People like to think about the life of archaeologists as a very adventurous endeavour. They are right, except that in my experience is has mainly to do with extreme logistics, rather than dark dungeons and holy relics.Two weeks ago, I had started thinking about what to write in my Day of Archaeology post. I was already in Gortyna, Crete, to study ceramic finds for my PhD. I spent my days in a sunny and dusty storage building, classifying and drawing late Roman and early Byzantine potsherds. Something very normal. No adventure involved, but still I was in Crete, one of the most amazing places I have ever been. Every day looked the same, with the exception of Sunday (afternoon). Occasional excitement for a few cooking pots, a painted jug. “Fun” counting and weighing sherds one by one, trying to develop new ways to assess depositional history. Not so different from what they told us last year from Knossos, just one hour of driving from Gortyna.4th to 5th century cooking pots – The Day of Archaeology I had imagined before THE callThen, on Tuesday 19th June 2012, ten days ago, I got a phone call. THE phone call. The phone call that turns my life upside down. And my 29th June 2012, Day of Archaeology, became totally different from what I had imagined.I was being hired as museum assistant at the Ministry of Culture in Italy. A permanent position. Il posto fisso, as we say in Italy. If you think of Italian bureaucracy as a slow and inefficient monster, you have to adjust your views, drastically. I was asked to be in Rome in a few days to sign the contract. I had to leave Crete in less than 24 hours. Pack half of my stuff, and leave the other half there, together with my car and tons of potsherds waiting to be studied. Poor Alessandro, who was with me in Gortyna, moved to Athens instead of spending two weeks alone in the Mesara. I am lucky, and I have some good friends in Rome. I spent 5 days in Rome waiting to sign the contract. I went to two international conferences, visited the Soprintendenza office where ArcheoFOSS took place only two weeks ago, attended the Baptism of a friends’ baby and met many friends. That’s the adventurous everyday life of an archaeologist in Rome.On Monday 25th June, I signed the contract it the magnificent Ministry headquarters palace. And I took a train from Rome to Genoa on the same day. On Tuesday, I did my first working day, at the office of the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici della Liguria, waiting to move to my destination: the archaeological site of Albintimilium, close to France. The place where Nino Lamboglia started his pioneering study of (Late) Roman pottery more than 60 years ago.Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici della Liguria, Palazzo Reale, GenovaAnd so comes my Day of Archaeology. At the office, making phone calls to organise my stay in the Riviera di Ponente, speaking with new colleagues, taking instructions on the tasks I will be doing next week, joining the trade union and above all trying to get an idea of what is happening to my life on the day of my 29th birthday.Day of Archaeology this year is on my birthday http://t.co/CI76hAoX #dayofarch— Stefano Costa (@stekosteko) May 13, 2012In my 10 years doing archaeology, I’ve seen that you never know what is going to happen and you have to be always prepared to change strategy to follow your path.

"391","In 2011 I gave up nearly two months of my life on three large community excavations. For free. Zilch. Nowt. Nothing. In fact it has actually cost me a lot of money to be involved. I often get asked why. Before I get the chance to answer, the interrogator normally smiles while pipeing up their own pre-conceived thought on the matter. It goes along the lines of, “Ah, you love doing that stuff don’t you?”They are right of course, I do enjoy it, I would not do it otherwise. But there is another reason behind my apparent madness. I am a student at the University of Wales Newport Caerleon campus. I am studying for a MA in Regional History and a lot of the course is based on historical landscape interpretation. Quite simply, it is landscape archaeology in another guise. And I enjoy it, immensely. The reasons behind this are multiple. For starters the study is non-invasive, as such no archaeology is destroyed; it is cheap –  it costs me nothing to walk for hours using my eyes while taking notes and photographs; it is important to me that every available means of non invasive information is gleaned from my site of study prior to any possible excavation; lastly, and not by any means should this be last on my list, I have been blessed with tutors who have an active interest in my chosen area of study. That is probably the most important cog behind this. The advice and guidance is, quite simply, second to none.That is why I volunteer on excavation projects! If my non invasive study is successful, and I see no reason why it shouldn’t be, then the next logical step is to put together an achievable excavation strategy. And it excites me.The first community project I was involved with in 2011 was the Caerleon ‘Lost City Excavations’ which strangely enough, were in Caerleon. The excavations came about through a geophysical survey undertaken as part of their studies. Led by Dr Pete Guest of the Cardiff School of History Archaeology and Religion, based within Cardiff University. I probably gained more experience from that excavation than any other. It was invaluable.The recently discovered port wall on the banks of the river Usk, Caerleon.Next up was a CADW organised excavation at Tinkinswood in Glamorgan. This lasted for two weeks. Yet again, I was fortunate to glean a lot of information on how a community excavation should be run. The site held this amazing atmospheric feel that made you tingle at times. It is hard to put a reason behind this, but it did. It is an Early Neolithic structure and it is pleasing to announce that all of the questions behind the reasons for excavation were more or less answered. Seeing as the first excavations were carried out there in the early 20C, the incredible amount of finds indicates that there should be no reason to excavate further for some considerable time to come. One of the best things things about this excavation came about through the late winter sunsets that we had chance to witness.A setting sun at Tinkinswood. It really was a magical setting.The last community excavation I was involved in was St Lythans. Quite lterally, just down the road from Tinkinswood. Another Neolithic structure, this site had not been excavated before. Once again, I was fortunate to learn from the role of a volunteer looking in towards how the site was run. Towards the end of the excavation I was negated to open a trench away from the main investigation. It was wet, cold and uncomfortable, but Tom and I just got on with it, while listening to the squeals of delight while the other volunteers excavated finds near to the structure.I am on the left of the picture as you look at it. Sometimes it is just better to get on with what you are asked to do…So, what has this got to do with the Day of Archaeology 2012? Quite simply I always keep a photographic diary of my exploits, as such I was able to deliver a talk this afternoon on volunteering in the archaeological sector at Pontypool Museum. I did not beat around the bush and it went down well. Good luck everybody, I hope you enjoyed my blog. David Standing.The Experiencing Volunteering on Community Archaeology Projects by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"392","For the Day of Archaeology 2012 and the end of my course on Christian and Moslem archeology (4th-20th centuries) in the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, we went on a field trip to downtown Haifa to see remnants from bygone times marking the contemporary landscape. Strolling along Jaffa Street we examined the houses built at the beginning of the 20th century, following the construction of Haifa harbor and the building of the Hejaz Railways, which connected Haifa to the holy Moslem cities.The houses represent various Ottoman (16th-20th) styles and traditions, and there are also a few cemeteries and religious institutions, both Moslem and Christian, along the street. In spite of its beauty and historical importance, the street, inhabited nowadays by an impoverished Arab population, is neglected. Rumors say that the neglect of this area stems, not only from political grounds, but from a process of gentrification that attracts rich people into this neighborhood in the center of town and forces the poor population to leave. Standing in the shed of one of the old buildings, I referred to the idea that the structure of a neighborhood, such as that of Jaffa Street, was vital for the reproduction of social life of the community living there. The obliteration of historical knowledge, on the other hand, by violent act of foundation of a new neighborhood can produce a tangible influence on people’s identities. The students, however, when asked to comment on the status of preservation of the contemporary landscape were reluctant to express their opinion. Their reluctance may be related to their technological background and lack of a humanistic one. It may also be the result of the composition of the course, attended mostly by Arab students who are unwilling to express their opinion regarding the contemporary landscape as a sort of a protest against the State because of their displacement and dispossession by the hegemonic culture.

"393","A day of many colours, it started with dark grey clouds and a blue green sea with white-topped waves, as I headed to a finds drop! I had to hand over a box of finds to a National Trust colleague,  from a dig we did on Brownsea Island so they can create a display for Festival of the British Archaeology event at the end of July. A drive through the glistening rain to the Warminster office, past lush green trees and between kamikaze birds jumping out of bushes! First another finds drop, this time a feely bag activity for another NT  colleague to use in Gloucestershire for FofBA. Then up the stairs past magnolia walls to my desk, first sort out more activities stuff for yet another FofBA event, this time  at Corfe Castle, spinning and weaving kit, colouring sheets, a notice to say we are closed for lunch (so my volunteers can get a break) and some pictures of mosaics. One thing I really wanted to get done was a photomontage in memory of ‘Gerry the Rope’, who passed away recently and we  will miss him so much at our event. He was a historical interpreter who had been coming to Corfe Castle for about twenty years doing rope making (both Medieval and Victorian), games, pole lathe demonstrations and candle making. He was a great communicator and friend.As late afternoon approached I had to turn my mind to getting everyting ready for our excavations that start on Monday!  write and print risk assessment, get day volunteer form printed, and  go to the shed to sort the tools.  We are digging up the last of the mosaics at Chedworth Roman Villa; they had been re-covered by the Victorians. It’s the last part of a big Heritage Lottery Fund project to put a new cover building over the mosaics and the reinterpretation of the site. Three weeks of mosaic digging, Yay! Red, purple, green, yellow, blue ’gorilla’ buckets, soft bruhses, hand shovels and a pick axe!  The last item is for prising up the tarmac path. Note to self ‘bring foot pump to blow up flat wheelbarrow tyre’Nearly the end of the day,  just a couple of things to do before the weekend. One is to send a flint report, web link and finds drawing to an artist, Simon Ryder, who is making an art work for the ExLab project, part of he Cultural Olympiad down in Weymouth. He is getting a 3D scan and printed model of a Mesolithic Portland Chert microlith which we excavated from a site on the cliff edge near Eype in West Dorset, an exciting project. The final job was to check a newsletter article about a pottery grenade found at Corfe Castle and finally identifed 25 years after it was dug up!  Thanks to the Wessex Archaelogy  finds specialist for posting the pot on the Medieval Pottery Research Group facebook site, the wonders of social media.So into my Red Berlingo and southwards to Weymouth, with the wheelbarrow rattling in the back.   The Bits and Pieces by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"394","In honor of the Day of Archaeology, in which we endeavor to display the “wide variety of work our profession undertakes day-to-day across the globe” (Day of Archaeology 2012 [archaeologists cite things]), I’m throwing this together as an archaeologist who embraces three different roles within the profession, has worked across 10 states and 3 foreign countries (Mexico, Cuba, and the British Virgin Islands), and still hasn’t finished graduate school (much to the chagrin of many, including myself).To convey this complex existence, I’m choosing an archaeological metaphor and excavating my desk. My workspace is, to no surprise, a reflection of the many things that occupy my time, pique my interest, and, I hope, lead to some insight into the pasts of the common people of history, a group that counts my ancestors, German and Welsh immigrants, among its numbers. I have imposed a classification system on the contents of my desk, by which I will unpack the contents and, in turn, my life as an archaeologist working in the SAU Research Station of the Arkansas Archeological Survey.BooksIndiana Jones once told a student (while running from the KGB) “If you want to be a good archaeologist, you gotta get out of the library.” While I fully endorse this sentiment, you must realize that a lot of archaeological research involves bookwork. We read a lot about the work of our forebears as a way to help orient our own research, building on and modifying that which came before, and to avoid scientific dead-ends. The books on my desk include those oriented towards:Dissertation: I am a doctoral candidate at the College of William & Mary in Virginia, the cradle of historical archaeology in the United States. I am trying to knock out a dissertation that will be the final step in my formalized education. This requires both books on epistemological issues relevant to the way I do research, such as Tim Murray’s Time and Archaeology or Anders Andrén’s Between Artifacts and Texts: Historical Archaeology in Global Perspective. Combining the clarity of thinking derived from such sources with the results of fieldwork are then combined with the insight derived from other books, such as D.W. Meinig’s The Shaping of America and Kenneth Lewis’s The American Frontier to produce a document that will add to the historiography of southwest Arkansas and the American West… and earn me a diploma (please please please).Teaching: I just finished teaching two classes at Southern Arkansas University, one a survey of world archaeology and the other a criminal justice research methods class. The detritus from preparing the lectures, including Catherine Hakim’s Research Design and Henn et al’s A Critical Introduction to Social Research still haven’t left my desk. They’re actually checked out from the University of Arkansas (5 hours away), so the next time I get called up to the coordinating office in Fayetteville, I’ll drop them off.Methods: We demonstrate our competence as archaeologists in the field, showing each other and the cosmos that we can dig properly (carefully and fast), map precisely, and document our findings appropriately. I’ve got Hester et al’s Field Methods in Archaeology on my book rack for reference, and the bookshelves surrounding my desk are full of books on aerial remote sensing and LiDAR research.Conference preparation:  One of the high points of any archaeologist’s professional year is a conference. For me, that usually means the Society for Historical Archaeology meetings, though in my current position the Arkansas Archeological Society conference is important as well. I’d like to go to the Fields of Conflict conference this year, but Budapest is a bit out of the range of my wallet (my truck needs work…). This week, I’ve been pulling together a session for the SHA with colleagues and classmates at William & Mary, and I’ve been using the abstract books from past conferences and De Cunzo and Jameson’s Unlocking the Past to write abstracts and encourage the session to take form.Fieldwork PapersAs mentioned above, proper note taking is an integral part of archaeology. Documentation of context is key. It separates us from looters, provides a basis for scientific work, and is a backstop for ideas and information that might otherwise get missed. If ideas were baseballs, an archaeological dig is like being a catcher behind home plate, facing a battalion of pitching machines. Even if you’re Johnny Bench, you can only hold so many of those baseballs at once. Paperwork is like having a canvas bag to put those ideaballs (I’m liking this metaphor less and less) in so you don’t lose them. On my desk may be found-        A green 3-ring binder from Area B of the 2012 Arkansas Archeological Society Training Dig, directed by my boss/friend/mentor Jamie Brandon. See his post here on the dig itself. The stack of papers inside is probably 2 inches thick. All of that came from two weeks in the field. It’s a lot of stuff to sift through, but every sweat-stained word is archaeological gold.-        Field books. I see three, though there may be more buried in there somewhere. These nifty little books, usually with yellow covers, have waxed pages, making them resilient in rainy or sweaty conditions, and are the place where we jot our notes about the project we’re working on. My field book from the Society Dig contains the shot log for our surveyor’s total station, so we have a redundant copy of all that information. I also have my field book for site visits done on behalf of the Survey. The notes I take in the field can then be transposed into either a site form, which I submit by way of report to the Survey, or included in subsequent publications on that research. Writing notes, particularly under hot or busy conditions, is one of the disciplines that archaeologists must learn. As with so many other things, when it comes to notes, it’s better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. In some positions, such as federal jobs, field books are part of the paperwork associated with a project and subject to subpoena and other legal strictures, so don’t draw too many cartoons about gophers in them.TechnologyThe final big section of research-related equipment can be classed as technology.  Technological advancements in computing, remote sensing (Johnson 2005), data sharing (Kansa 2012), and numerous other fronts in the past twenty years is revolutionizing archaeology. The very fact of this blog post, the internet, and personal computing is evidence of this. Hallmarks of this advancement are, of course, found on my desk.-        Computer: Shocking, I know. Nowadays, computers are everywhere and used in most pursuits, but mine is special, consarnit! First, it’s a laptop on a dock, which is necessary given the high mobility of many archaeologists. Since you can’t bring sites to you, we have to go to the sites, often for extended periods of time. We just finished two weeks at Historic Washington State Park, and in the last year, I’ve spent weeks at Toltec Mounds, Wallace’s Ferry, and Prairie Grove, all in Arkansas, as well as making numerous trips to the Coordinating Office in Fayetteville. My Army job was just like that, as was my time with the NPS, just that in the federal gigs, the projects are usually spread over greater areas. Laptops are essential in taking our computing power along with. Crucial to that computing power is the software held on the machine, particularly, in my case…-        Geographic information system (GIS) software. I do a lot of work with spatial documentation and analysis, so I need mapping software. Being able to document the location of sites and areas within sites is an important part of the documentation process.-          Scanner: I scan lots of things, primarily to make back-ups (hard to lose all copies of a document) and to share them with colleagues. Information sharing is a big part of the research process, as those who share your interests and expertise are not likely under the same roof as you. This is partly why conferences are so important. Information exchange stimulates, as Poirot liked to call them, “the little grey cells” and advance the discipline. Scanners help make that possible.-        Telephone: Again, rather mundane, but an important part of my job. The Arkansas Archeological Survey does a lot of public outreach work for people of all walks of life from across the state. My station covers 11 counties in southwest Arkansas, and I get calls to come out and look at sites or assist colleagues at museums and parks in the area with public outreach work (come to the Red River Heritage Symposium at Historic Washington State Park on the 28th of July). Much of that begins with a phone call.Other/MiscellaneousAs this all should indicate, I spend a LOT of time working, well more than 40 hours a week. As a result, I spend a lot of time in the office or in the field, and my desk contents reflect that.-        Coffee mug and empty Coke/Diet Coke cans: I am a caffeine addict, plain and simple. I often get little more than 5 hours of sleep a night, and with as stacked of a to-do list as I have, it’s rather unavoidable. I can’t keep up with a friend, who runs on five cappuccinos a day, but there are times when I wonder how awesome that feels. I’m guessing “pretty.”-        Mulerider Baseball cup: Our host institution and my erstwhile employer, Southern Arkansas University has a great baseball team, and the Muleriders just won the GAC Championship… again. Great job, guys! One of the ways I avoid having the pressures of all of these jobs and responsibilities burn me out is by having a mental outlet. For me, that’s baseball and hockey. We don’t get much of the latter down here. However, the baseball stadium is right across the parking lot from the office (really, I can see it from my desk), and those evening games are a nice break from the grind.-        Yellow duct tape: Why yellow, you might ask? Because every station in the Survey system was allocated a color to mark their equipment with so that we could tell whose stuff is whose when we collaborate on projects. Our station’s color is yellow, Henderson State’s is orange, Toltec’s is blue, etc. etc. etc. Marking things as ours helps avoid confusion and trowel fights.-        Field hat: I saved this for last because it’s one of my favorite things. For archaeologists, the attachments we form with crucial bits of equipment can be very strong. Many people still have their first trowels, and carefully guard them (think of a mitt for a baseball player). They’re things, but they’re things intimately tied up in the art of our discipline, and that makes them special. For me, there are three things that fall into this category. My trowel is the first, and I keep it distinct from all other trowels by wrapping the handle in hockey stick tape. The second is my Brunton pocket transit (think a compass on steroids with neon flames shooting down its hood), which is not only a very useful bit of equipment, it was also my father’s when he was doing his dissertation, and that carries great meaning to me. Finally, there is my field hat, a mid-crown cattleman with a 4” brim from Sunbody Hats in Houston, Texas. No matter how hot it gets, it’s always a little cooler under this thing, and it was a wedding gift from Jimmy Pryor, the owner of Sunbody and a childhood friend. It’s a link to home and my wife all at once, and it cheers me up when I’ve been out on a project for a couple of weeks and starting to get a little barn sour.Now, having looked at these piles for a few hours while writing this, it may be time to do some cleaning…ReferencesAndrén, Anders1997     Between Artifacts and Texts: Historical Archaeology in Global Perspective.

"395","My Day of Archaeology continues (for first half, click this link)12:00 Lunch with my Research Associate, Ryan Placchetti, discussing our efforts and the closer and closer ties with our British colleagues; how to make the definitive version of the dataset. We have recorded all of the field catalogues at this point and are moving on to examining every artifact we have from Ur, starting with a small subset, that of cylinder seals. Those need to be updated in a unified database, but the unified (if still somewhat flawed) database won’t be up for another week or two according to our colleague, Birger Helgestad, in London.Got a message from a friend who is a professional photographer that he will be available to help document the second half of my day (he took the picture in my first post, but months ago). My computer secretary file shows that the afternoon should be spent as most afternoons have been this week, writing entries for an artifact loan from Penn Museum to La Caixa Museum in Spain. Many of these artifacts were excavated at Ur and thus relate to my overall project. I have written 14 entries so far, but there are at least another 20 that need to be done. I’ve farmed a further dozen out to Phil Jones, a Sumerologist here at Penn, since they have lengthy cuneiform inscriptions. I have studied both Akkadian and Sumerian but am by no means a specialist in the languages.Writing entries for artifacts going on loan; photos by Kyle CassidySome of the objects we’re sending have been sent out on traveling exhibits before. I wrote entries for a few of them when they went to Beijing, but those were around 1,000 words each. These have to be only about 100 words. It’s good practice to be concise, but any archaeologist will tell you that every object is more complicated than it looks, and when you want to discuss the significance of a particular object, you are almost inevitably tempted to write and write and, well you get the point. Much like this blog entry, I could be more concise, so I’ll just get to the task of writing exhibit catalogue entries.High prow and stern boat model is in the background; flat, decked boat is in the foreground.3:30pm I’ve spent the past hour and a half in the Traveling Exhibits holding room, examining some of the more complex artifacts that I am writing about. The first is a pair of clay boats that seem simple enough, but one of them is expected, the other is not. As I write about these artifacts, I try to make sure that all of our info on them is correct, correlates with field records where available and with archaeological thought of the period, styles, etc. The boat from Fara with high, curved prow and stern is exactly what we would expect from southern Mesooptamia in the Early-Middle Bronze Age, a reed river or marsh boat, with bundles of reeds tied together at stem and stern. The other, said in our records to be from Ur in the Old Babylonian (Middle Bronze) period doesn’t quite fit. First of all, the excavator at Ur does not mention a model boat from this season or any season within four years of the accession date. Secondly, the flat form with partial deck at prow and stern is in the history of ship building usually seen to be later, typically the end of the Late Bronze Age. Essentially, this appears to be a sea-going, plank-built vessel, akin to those on the Mediterranean at the time of the Sea Peoples and beyond. Maybe this is an early occurrence of that type, but without good context, I can’t know. I can’t solve the issues right now, but I can mention the questions in the interpretation of significance in the brief catalogue entry.Apart from boat models, I’m also covering stone statuary today. I look again atExamining ED sculpture from Khafaje; notice the resemblance?an example from Khafaje and wonder where the left eye came from. In early photos, it is missing, yet this statue has two eyes. The left (proper) is a replacement, but I’m not sure when it was put there or by whom. We are sending two similar statue heads to Spain as well and I take a look at them. I take notes on these and a few other pieces, formulating most of about six catalogue entries, though I still have to chase down references for the bibliographic sections.Even though I’ve been working with artifacts for 20 years, I still get an extraordinary feeling when in the presence of something so old, something formed by human hands thousands of years ago. Even in a relatively clinical environment, the power of ancient artwork is palpable. This is the kind of inspiration that keeps me going in writing some of the entries that might otherwise seem mundane. It’s why I wanted to be in the holding area today rather than only in my office checking books. When working directly with the objects, I notice things I can’t possibly notice in photos, and the personal enjoyment I get at staring into the shell and bitumen eyes of a 4500-year-old stone worshiper, or feeling the curve of a 3600-year-old model boat is indescribable. I may be working on virtual recreations of the ancient city of Ur, but I still believe in the importance of physical museums and the power of seeing ancient things in person. We need digital collections for study and understanding, dissemination of information, teaching, and for many other reasons; but, we need the presence of antiquities in publically accessible institutions as well to promote that unusually motivating and inspiring connection with too-long forgotten people across millennia.We are all people, and we all are part of history.The Penn Museum Archaeologist; Part 2 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"396","Showing my visitor around the stores. I’m the one wearing the attractive ID card jewellery.I’m a lecturer and Keeper of Collections at the Institute of Archaeology, UCL. At this time of year, teaching has finished and our students have started to wander off to do fieldwork or work on their dissertations (or at least that’s what they tell us). Things tend to calm down a bit as a result, and we get a chance to wrap up the last bits of marking and turn to our own research projects. For me, this often means a chance to work on sorting out problems on the collections side of things, although we usually see a steady stream of visiting researchers through the summer, as they exploit their own semester breaks.For today, my main concern is finishing off some postgraduate marking, but already I’ve a couple of other things booked that might distract me from that for a while. We’ll see how it pans out.9.00 am. I arrive in my office, and start getting ready for a visitor from Haifa University. Late yesterday afternoon a colleague requested a store tour, and I haven’t had much chance to prepare. The first job is to make sure the store is presentable, so I do a bit of housecleaning and put away the material I was working on; then I look up my visitor’s home page, to see if I can get a feel for the sort of stuff she might be interested in. There’s not a lot of help there, so I decide to just wing it. Lets hope she finds our storage shelves and efforts to combat dust fascinating.There’s a bit of time before our meeting, so I send an email to set up a research visit for next week (to sample some material from Tell Abu Hureyra in Syria) and another thanking a previous researcher for sending me one of her recently published articles. As it happens, she was actually working here during the Day of Archaeology last year. How spooky is that? I print out a copy of the article to put on file (note to self: buy more plastic-coated paperclips), and start adding publication details from it to records in our objects database. This gets cut short when:9.40 am. My visitor arrives, and we spend a pleasant hour looking at material in the Leventis Gallery, newly installed since she was last at the Institute, then admiring the artefact store and the sterling work my volunteers do in improving object storage. Our polycord ring supports for wobbly pots get the thumbs up.  Our old 1950s wooden storage drawers get the thumbs down. We’ve managed to replace these elsewhere in the building, but haven’t yet raised the funds to do the store. If anyone has a rich benefactor to spare, maybe you can point them our way?The wobbly-based potsAnd how we make the supports11.00 am. I meet with another colleague to look at some material associated with J.D. Evans, a former director of the Institute. Todd has been sorting through Evans’ archive, temporarily here while its being assessed. I’m hoping he can help identify some of our mystery boxes down in the store. The first one we look at contains metal objects that Evans sent up to our conservation department, and which came back beautifully conserved but without any indication of their parent site (crimes against curators, anyone?). Fortunately some do have excavation labels, and the cryptic field codes are identified as belonging to the Wiltshire site of Stockton. Neither of us knows of any connection between Evans and this site, so conclude that he was just acting as a departmental intermediary for someone else.The second box contains dozens of paper finds bags, nicely labelled with full context details, conveniently including the site name (Earls Farm Down). Apparently Evans excavated this site in 1956, before coming to work at the Institute. Todd has a few more EFD finds with the archive in his office, so we’ll be consolidating this material before figuring out where it should ultimately go – probably to a museum in Devizes or Salisbury. A few random bits and pieces have snuck into this drawer, so I put them aside for further investigation.Earls Farm Down. Some repacking may be required ….Our last group of material comes in two very nicely constructed wooden boxes, and seem to be botanical and stone samples from Evans’ work at Knossos. These will need to be integrated into current research on the site, before being returned to Greece.Todd investigates Knossos. Note the fabulously made box12.00 pm. Lunch beckons. An egg sandwich and cup of orange and lotus blossom tea. Neither was particularly photogenic, so I leave them to your imagination.12.30 pm. I do a bit of research on Stockton, and establish that the Institute of Archaeology excavated it in 1962 as one of their training digs. I print out some new labels for my rescued metal objects, and move them in with our other Stockton finds. Doing this makes me realise that everything in the Stockton drawer needs repacking. I gingerly close the drawer, and put it on my list of things to do.Coming out into the corridor, I bump into Ulrike, which reminds me that I have to finish second marking her MA in Artefact Studies course. Urgently.Portfolio marking1.00 pm. I set to marking object portfolios. Urgently. To give you the background for this, each student gets assigned an artefact set when they start the course. These contain 10 objects, which might be from a single site or broader region. The idea is that students apply core knowledge from lectures to this material, allowing them to develop a range of practical skills, from observation to description and research.  Each item is measured, drawn, photographed and catalogued, then contextualised. To date, I’ve put together a range of sets from the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, Cyprus, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, India and Pakistan, and hope to add new sets from England and Turkey next year. It’s always a challenge; the students don’t have any prior experience of the material cultures they are dealing with, so this is an excellent test of their research skills. I always throw in one particularly curious object just to see how they cope.3.30 pm. Ulrike and I have a meeting to agree on marks for some of the portfolios. I haven’t finished them all, but as she is about to head off to Romania on fieldwork we need to get sorted whatever we can. I then get on with marking the rest. It’s a slow process. Because these are objects from my collection, I like to check everything very carefully, including following up suggested publication references in case there’s something we should put in our own records. On the flip side, I also don’t want anyone getting away with a dodgy cf on my watch.5.20 pm. Not all my bits in boxes have been cross-examined, but I’m tired and I have a blog post to write up. So time to pack up and call it a day.

"397","My job involves visiting and advising on management of archaeological sites for the UKs largest wildlife charity, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). We manage land across Britain from Shetland to Cornwall, Suffolk to Ceredigion and also throughout Northern Ireland. I get to see an amazing variety of sites from shell middens to hillforts to 19th century timber storage ponds – thousands of sites including 200 which are Scheduled (legally protected). Many of the best preserved archaeological sites can be found in wild places because this land has not been subject to intensive agriculture or commercial development. In particular we have hundreds of World War Two sites and I’d stick my neck out and say we must have one of the largest and best preserved collections of any land owner (with exception of the Ministry of Defence!).The military used many wild places for training, storage,  firing/bombing ranges or  fortified them against invasion.  Heathland and coastal wetland were particularly heavily used because they were out of the way spotst where they could conduct live firing. The military flooded areas as a form of  invasion defence, leading wildlife to recolonise in the 1940s – so conservationists have alot to thank the military for in Suffolk, see:http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/m/minsmere/archaeology.aspxToday I visited two wetland sites in Suffolk which have well preserved buildings – RSPB Boyton Marsh and Hollesley Marsh in Suffolk. I was hosted by wardens Dudley, Reg and Aaron – a happier crew you will not meet, and once you get to see where they work you can understand why. Nice sunny day in the countryside, quiet landscapes with grass bending in the wind and some beautiful concrete block houses and pillboxes! Boyton was an Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) firing range where tanks trained in the run up to D-Day and a group of block houses survive which would have operated pulley systems to move targets for the tanks to fire at. It is hard to imagine the noise, and the tanks trundling past today. At Hollesely we have a beautiful pillbox, which was part of the coastal crust of defences that carpeted the east coast of England – and a nice place to stop on a walk, eat your sandwiches and look at the view. We discussed how we good interpret these sites for visitors and keep them in good order – luckily,  by and large they were built to last!

"398","Today is a slightly unusual day in the office, as everyone at Worcestershire Archaeology is preparing for the opening of our new premises ‘The Hive’ which is situated in the centre of Worcester. Our new building is quite controversial due to its ultra-modern appearance (it’s covered in gold tiles!) but the inside is amazing, bringing together both public and University libraries, the Archive and Archaeology Service and the local History Centre all under one roof! It is a fantastic resource to have in the county and I feel lucky to be part of it.So as well as carrying out my every day tasks today, I am also assisting with putting together a display of archaeological finds in one of the public areas and the day shall end with a small staff party to celebrate the opening and making it this far!9.15am: First things first – I need a cup of coffee to get things kick-started! I shall then go through my emails and respond to any which require my attention.10.00am: Back to my current project. This week, I have been working on a fairly sizeable assemblage of Roman building material from a site which our field team excavated just outside of Kenchester, Herefordshire. It’s an interesting group of material comprising a variety of tile forms and fabrics. I am starting where I left off last night, entering data into the site database – primarily number of fragments, weight, fabric, form, dimensions, general observations and date.11.00am: I have been asked if I can go upstairs and help with labelling up some of the replica Roman and medieval pottery that has been put on display.  They’re mainly copies of vessel types commonly found locally but there are a couple of imports as well, so I shall be taking my reference books with me!11.30am: A large box of chocolate brownies has appeared in the office – should keep me going whilst I wade through more boxes of tile!1.30pm: Have had a discussion with my colleague, Nick Daffern about some finds which I have been recently working on. Nick is a Palynologist (pollen geek!) and these finds were retrieved during an environmental borehole survey that he was overseeing. They included some very well preserved Late Iron Age and early Roman sherds which have helped to date certain areas of the site.2.00pm: I am starting to spot some patterns in the assemblage regarding certain fabrics being used  for specific tile forms. I am also pulling out the more complete examples so that they can be illustrated for use in the final report. I am hoping that by the end of today, I shall have all of the ceramic building material from the site recorded, so that I can get on with writing the actual report next week.3.00pm: Back upstairs to help with another display. I wrote the labels last week and these are now printed out and waiting for the accompanying tray of finds. Deb Fox, the Worcester City Museum archaeologist is putting the display together and the finished result looks really effective.5.00pm: Last tile recorded, last brownie consumed and it’s time to head off for a glass of cava to celebrate the opening of our new ‘home’!The Roman tiles, display cabinets and chocolate brownies by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"399","On this “Day of Archaeology”, I’m busy preparing to head off to the field (in sunny Tuscany (!!)), square away some data, and finish work on some tech consulting.  That last bit is a clue that I’m not really a “normal archaeologist”. Actually, I’ve never met an archaeologist that I’d consider normal –  which is what attracted me to this field in first place. But even among archaeologists, I’m something of an odd-ball.I have a background in Near Eastern archaeology, and did my dissertation research looking at interactions between Egypt and the Levant (modern Israel, Palestine, Lebanon) in the Early Bronze Age. But for various reasons, both personal and professional, I shifted gears toward the digital side of archaeology, co-founded a nonprofit with my wife (and boss!), and for the past 10 years, I’ve loved almost every minute of my work day. Except writing grant proposals (but there are some necessary evils in all work).My research and professional interests focus on archaeological data, and much less on digging and field work for myself. This focus means I have a very different professional network, set of collaborators, and work life. Though I work closely with other archaeological professionals, I’m also heavily engaged with folks well outside the discipline, including Web and information scientists, digital librarians and archivists, technology companies, “digital humanists”, and researchers in scholarly communications.I keep such odd company because I’m really interested in improving the way archaeologists communicate and share their research. Archaeology is intensely multidisciplinary and collaborative. It involves inputs from all sorts of different sciences, and many archaeologists work together in large teams. Sharing the results of all this research needs to reflect the collaborative nature of the field, and it needs to speak with people in other disciplines and walks of life. That’s why I’m so interested in making it archaeological data more open, easier to share, and easier to reuse.My primary project is Open Context. It’s a system for publishing archaeological data, openly, on the Web, for all to browse and reuse. On this “Day of Archaeology”, I’m busy indexing tens of thousands of detailed records of archaeological contexts, objects, bones, and other material from Kenan Tepe, a major excavation in Turkey led by Bradley Parker. This collection represents the monumental effort of almost 10 years of field work. You can browse around its photo archives and see many thousands of pictures, mainly of dirt. Though it is free to access and use, the data are priceless. Excavation is a destructive process, and the documentation describing such excavations will be the only record available to revisit and re-analyze excavation results. That’s why comprehensive publishing with platforms like Open Context, as well as archiving with digital repositories like tDAR, the ADS, or the CDL is so important.As this blog post should make clear, I love working with the Web. And what I like most about it is that I work with a growing and vibrant community of like minded people who want to see more from archaeology than costly journal articles read by a narrow few. The developers of ARK, Portable Antiquities, all the collaborators of Pelagios, and the bottom-up group linking archaeological data, are all hugely talented and make my work life rewarding and fun. All this makes archaeology (for me) as much about community and the future as it is about the past.The Digging on the Web by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"400","Happy Day of Archaeology 2012 folks!Presently, I am a curator for the research facility at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex in Moundsville, West Virginia.  We are the first curation facility for archaeological artifacts built within the state (opened in 2008) and we house thousands of artifacts either excavated by state/federal organizations or personal collections donated by citizens.  The complex consists of not only the research/collections wing but is also home to the Delf Norona Museum.My job varies on a daily basis but today I continued inventorying artifacts from a Fort Ancient Native American site formerly located in the southern part of the state.  Notice I use the word “formerly.”   Like so many archaeological sites worldwide, the site was destroyed after excavation and no longer exists.  It is now home to an industrial plant, one reason why our jobs as archaeologists are so valuable!  We are recording a past that may not be around for the future due to industrialization, roads, or any number of other destructive changes that can occur to the land.Shell Tempered Cord Marked SherdsAround 10:30 am, I looked up from analyzing a few prehistoric ceramic sherds and saw the observation window filled with a group of inquisitive, happy kids visiting the complex for a field trip.  I must admit, it has taken some time getting used to having people stare at you while you work throughout the day, but I now welcome it.  Who knows, maybe there is a future archaeologist in the crowd!Possible future archaeologists!This afternoon, we were fortunate to have Christina, one of our regular volunteers come in.  She is currently working on processing a large artifact collection that was donated to the facility many years ago.  She spent a few hours washing  lithic artifacts that will ultimately be labeled, sorted, and made available for researchers.  I don’t know what we would do without all of our reliable, hardworking volunteers!For me, Day of Archaeology 2012 ended with inputting data into our always growing database (with some background 1980′s genre music playing from the internet radio to break the silence).  While it’s far from being glamorous, it’s priceless work.  At the end of the day, I’m just trying to do my part to preserve a little bit of West Virginia’s past for our future.Inventorying prehistoric ceramic sherds  The Archaeology Lab Rat in West Virginia: Day 455 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"401","Today was pretty much a typical day of fieldwork at Mission San Joseph de Escambe in Molino, Florida.  We are in our fourth field season out at the mission site, which between 1741 and 1761 was home to a small community of Apalachee Indians and a Franciscan friar, along with a small Spanish infantry garrison of 4 men for a decade, and a larger 16-man Spanish cavalry garrison for just over a year. Our crew, consisting of ten students and one professor, gathered as usual at 7:30 a.m. on site to begin work.  The photo essay below will illustrate some of our normal daily activities as we gradually gather more and more information about the mission and its residents during the colonial era.As shown below, upon arrival at the site, our first task is to unstitch our excavation units from the plastic sheeting covering them, which is carefully sealed with rows of sandbags every afternoon before we go home in order to avoid water damage in case of Florida’s common afternoon and evening thunderstorms.At the same time, the total station is set up and resectioned for use during the day, fixing the instrument at a known point with respect to our established site grid, and allowing us to take vertical and horizontal measurements in all our active excavation units throughout the day’s work.  Sometimes this must be performed again during the day, especially after lunch when heat and simple gravity may have altered the tilt of the total station.  The photo below shows graduate supervisor Michelle Pigott working with her sister Eileen, volunteering this week at the site.Before beginning any new work, each unit must be carefully cleaned of all loose dirt that may have fallen in from the walls or ground surface during the stitching operation, and then bags and tags must be labeled for each separate provenience to be excavated, and paperwork filled out before any new dirt can be excavated.  Tools are unpacked and field notebooks updated to record daily site conditions, crew members present, and the objectives of the ongoing work.Once everything has been properly staged for the day, excavation can begin in each unit, sometimes using flat shovels designed to slice off thin layers of sediment across each unit and provenience, hoping to see soil stains or in situ artifacts before proceeding any deeper.  In the photo below, graduate supervisor Katie Brewer uses a flat shovel to excavate the uppermost deposits in a unit designed to track the course of a stockade wall constructed in 1760 at the site.More careful excavation requires the use of a trowel in order to exercise greater control over depth and speed of excavation.  The Marshalltown 5-inch pointing trowel is the instrument of choice.  Below, site supervisor Danielle Dadiego excavates a portion of the stockade trench already exposed in her unit.Below, undergraduate student Nick Simpson uses his trowel to remove loose dirt next to a profile excavated through a burned clay floor, possibly associated with the 1761 Creek Indian raid that destroyed the mission community.Our next post will show more scenes from our day.The A Day of Archaeology at Mission Escambe by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"402","We are a small archaeological unit (C.R Archaeology) based in Bangor, North Wales and because of our small size we often have very varied days! The Day of Archaeology 2012 is no exception with the two of us working on aselection of different tasks throughout the day.Matt Jones started his day washing out a load of empty beer bottles – not our glass recycling but a lovely assemblage of Victorian bottles found at Benarth Walled Gardens, Conwy. The gardener working there seems to have had a fondness for the local ale and the bottles are all from Conwy and Llandudno breweries.Once this washing was finished Matt stuck with finds and went to work on his assessment of Roman finds recovered during a 2001 excavation at Segontium, Caernarfon. The Roman Fort has undergone some difficult times recently but luckily Cadw have now stepped in to administer the site. This work is being carried out as part of our commitment to help charities & community groups and is being conducted free of charge.Whilst Matt had a day of finds Cat Rees had to attend to the much more mundane side of running a small business. The day started with checking the company emails and facebook site, writing a tender and then off to the bank to check that the money from a client had been paid in. That done it was time to process a batch of RAW photograph files into TIFFs so that they could be burnt to disc to accompany a building recording report for submission to Gwynedd Historic Environment Record. Not entirely sure this was what I had in mind when I made the decision to become an archaeologist – bit more Marcus Brody than Indiana Jones!!!After Cats breakneck start to the day it was time for putting together a projected income for an appointment with the banks small business adviser. Then onto starting a bit of a revamp of the company website and designing some new promotional material. If this wasn’t exciting enough the day ended with the printing out and binding of a set of reports for submission on Monday.This all sounds a bit dull but it is an important part of what we do – by setting up an independent unit the reality is that we sink or swim based on our own work and the effort we put in. But we have the flexibility to do our own thing and take on jobs simply because they interest us and having control our own time is fantastic. Not everyday is like this – the Day of Archaeology 2012 came at a strange time when we have just finished one project and are starting another on Tuesday so luckily next week will we will be free range rather than battery archaeologists!The Archaeology From Indoors – A Day in the Life of a Small Unit by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"403","Wieke surveying at Monte san Nicole I woke up this morning very excited about the Day of Archaeology, and looked over the first few posts while I ate my breakfast at home. It was a good moment to reflect on the last eleven months, since Day of Archaeology 2011. I’ve moved out of the shipping container (!) and now have a lovely flat near the park. I also now work full time, have been appointed a second post-doc position for the ‘other’ 20% of my time within my department (looking at Roman Minor Centres in the Pontine region). Technically, they have my fridays, but in practice we’re more flexible than that as they’ll need me for whole weeks at a time later in the year, so I’ll be working on Rural Life stuff today… 09:00 – and I’ve just arrived at work by bike- almost all of my colleagues bike or walk to work, even if they come from further afield, they’ll use the train. I check my email then get to grips with my to-do list (after tweeting it!). I’m happy because I’ve been able to cross a couple of things off it this week. I had to drop everything to get our CAA 2012 paper written up, after delivering it in Southampton in March (I’ve been on two lots of fieldwork and short holiday since- and haven’t had time to update my blog), and we’ve been working on the final push to get two pilot geophysical studies published. The latter isn’t quite finished, but it’s at the point of having been sent off to be read by someone other than me and Martijn- my project leader. We’re both at the point with it where we can’t really judge it objectively any more. I’m glad it’s almost done- it’s very difficult to write up research you didn’t conduct yourself, and I really hope that I’ve done justice to the work of the people involved before me!To Do List09.30 - … my elation turns into a sinking feeling as I ponder my to-do list. It looks OK in the picture, but the thing is, each of the things on the list has it’s own, usually longer list on another bit of paper somewhere. I’d been in the middle of writing a report tying up all of the loose ends from our 2011 fieldwork, when CAA and fieldwork intervened. It is a tricky job because we had to work out a lot of the data-handling as we went, so I don’t have a standard set of methods that I can update with the incidental details- everything needs to be carefully explained, every decision made in the field, every bit of statistics or image correction applied afterwards.10:00 - Ten AM on Friday is coffee and cake time for the whole institute, but I decide that today I have too much going on to take part in the chatter and socialising, and start looking at some raw data files for the report…10:15 - and my computer spectacularly crashes, fortunately the only thing it wipes out is the start of this post, which word can’t recover when I get everything rebooted… and my email is misbehaving so I decide coffee is a good idea after all. 10:30 - and I’m back at my desk. I’m working on a file from a site where gradiometer surveys last July showed the presence of several (probably Bronze Age) structures on a small plateau. This data is a series of surface MS (magnetic susceptibility) readings taken on the topsoil by the team in October, when I wasn’t there. They made a small but critical error in how they decided to place the readings on the grid set up for the geophysical surveys. It’s not a major problem, but it means I have to do about an hour’s careful editing work on the data before I can get it loaded into a program that lets me plot the results in a plan view, to let me look at spatial variations and compare them to other data. Luckily, the field team kept excellent notes about exactly how they gathered the data, so while it takes time, I can be sure that I have the right readings in the right place by lunchtime. I write it all up carefully in the report, and make a note to myself to update and improve the training notes and protocols I hand out to our student helpers. My morning’s work- the offset between the plot and the lines of the grid is intentional due to the mistake made collecting the data. Writing it all up…12:30 –  and I go to lunch in one of the amazing old buildings at the heart of the university with my team. Today,the canteen has mosterd soup (a local speciality) that everyone loves. We chat about the football, and the weather in a mixture of English and Dutch, and then head back over to the Institute for the rest of the day.13:30 – I’ve loaded the data into the plotting program and I’m making corrections to it (such as removing very high or low values, to better visualise subtle changes) when I hear a lot of commotion outside. It’s the bus being loaded with all the equipment needed by the teaching excavations at Crustumerium next month. It makes me grin, knowing people will soon be off to Italy, but for now I need to concentrate so it’s in with the earphones and on with the music.14:30 – I have to admit I’ve been sneaking onto the Day of Archaeology site and following the #dayofarchtag on twitter. The LAARC guys give me a five minute break by tracking down the contents of shelf 666 for me. Turns out, it holds a neat little bone gaming die from Roman London. I love small finds, I don’t get to work with them very often- though on this current project I’m learning a lot about protohistoric pottery. I’m fascinated by the little everyday things that make it into the archaeological record, probably more so than the big and shiny things that make the headlines.16:00 – I’ve finished with the first survey for the report. It takes a while to get everything into the GIS to compare it to the other surveys of the area we made in July, and information about pottery lying on the surface in October. I record everything I have done to the data, as well as the exact conditions it was collected under, then describe the pattern of values. Finally I write a short paragraph offering an archaeological interpretation of the data, taking into account everything we currently know about the site and the landscape. It’s really important to record things in this level of detail for any future researcher that needs to understand how the final plots were made, and why I concluded specific things about the site. It’s painstaking, and probably no-one will ever need to use it, but I’ve had the horrendous experience of trying to work with badly described geophysical data before, so I’m determined not to leave some potential future researcher in the same mess! I start with the next site. On this one, we did some surveys because workmen found a protohistoric storage vessel in a trench for an irrigation pipe, but the surveys didn’t show up anything structural. I still have to write them up in the same detail though!The gradiometer survey of the same area17:00 – Corien, another PhD student knocks on mine and Wieke’s door. Wieke is the PhD student I work with- the geophysics I do is part of a wider project encompassing her PhD research. We normally work until 18:00 but Corien reminds us that it is Friday, and drags us off for a post-work drink. Our project leader Martijn comes along too, and we’re joined by another PhD student from another part of the faculty. We chat about the path PhD students are expected to follow- all three of them are at different stages, and it’s quite different to the UK in some ways, so interesting to me. At six we part company and head off on our bikes…I’m about to submit this to the team at HQ, and while I wait for it go live I’m off to read as many of the other posts as I can fit in!

"404","Job title: Senior Properties HistorianOrganisation: English HeritageUsual base: BristolCurrently working on: Stonehenge visitor centreFind me at: @SueGreaneyToday in stats: 1 workshop/meeting (5.25hrs); 4 trains (3.5hrs);  2 tea runs (20mins); 1 colleague chat (45mins); 1 large chocolate muffin (5 mins); 1 very welcome beer (time tbc).Today I’ve been up to our West Midlands office in central Birmingham, with my colleague and curator Sara Lunt, to meet with our exhibition designers Haley Sharpe Design.  We’re all currently working flat-out on our permanent exhibition which will form part of the new Stonehenge visitor centre. We’re doing our display case layouts at the moment – thinking about how our archaeological finds will be mounted alongisde text, graphics and replicas.On the train on the way up to Birmingham I spend some time reviewing and updating my ‘to do’ list – I have so much to do at the moment that lists are the only way I can keep up with the next most urgent thing. Also checking into my e-mails and Twitter. I saw a great tweet the other day, something along the lines of – you don’t choose your career anymore, you just choose what to answer e-mails about! Well my e-mails are mostly about archaeology even if that definition gets stretched a little. With a hefty dose of project management thrown in.Not the type of building where you’d expect an archaeologist to spend the day… Photograph by Ell Brown via FlickrArriving at The Axis, where EH is based, I stop for a tea on the way. The meeting quickly gets underway. Case layouts is one of those tasks that needs a spatial mind – being able to imagine the 3D layouts of the cases from 2D plans and elevations. It’s also a bit like a jigsaw puzzle – well that object needs to sit alongside that text, but that story has to be on the same side as that group of other objects… We’ll be re-creating quite a number of archaeological contexts, so we talk through the details of these. Soon our meeting room table is covered.These meetings are quite intense but very creative and exciting – lots of ideas and hand waving today. Tea run no.2 and a grabbed sandwich. Time flies by and I forget to take a photo for this post – sorry! We talk reconstructions and look at recent examples we like. More work to be done here. Sara has been up this week to view the final objects we’re getting on loan from the Stonehenge Riverside Project and we look at where these fit in.We have to have a really good understanding of what stories we’re trying to get across. We’re been into the detail of the archaeology to such an extent that we now have to extract ourselves and think from the position of a visitor. Imagine you are a tourist from Europe, just arrived on a coach, with only a sketchy understanding of prehistory in your own country, let alone somewhere else entirely – what does this tiny bit of flint mean to them? We archaeologists can all get geekily excited about petit-tranchet derivatives, but really… it is the people of the prehistoric past who have to shine through our displays.We finish in good time – feeling satisfied that we’re nearly there with this task! I take the chance to catch up with another colleague Beth Thomas, the Stonehenge World Heritage Site Co-ordinator who happens to be in the Birmingham office today. We talk about some upcoming meetings relating to projects happening in the World Heritage Site. She’s also just launched a newsletter Megalith for the WHS which looks good (spot my contribution).On the train on the way home (after devouring a large chocolate muffin and some fruit) I write up the action points from our day for everyone to make sure they complete all their tasks. I also check details for Monday – I have a site visit at Stonehenge with a colleague, following by another meeting with our exhibition designers at our Salisbury office.  It’s all go. I feel like we might need one of those Olympic style countdown clocks…. in which case it is 473(ish) days to go until we open – gulp. You can find out more about our plans on the EH website. I check into Twitter and have a conversation about capes(!), and read some of the posts on this site, before finally reaching home to catch up with my other half and his day. Now I’m writing this with a welcome Friday beer. Cheers!PS.

"405","Another year, another Day of Archaeology. Kudos and thank yous to the core staff facilitating this blog!That said, this year provides more ways to connect with my first academic love, archaeology. Today, I’ve spent time culling through links in my social media feed for the latest archaeology reports and news, a practice I do daily. In fact, just yesterday, that practice yielded an article find completely pertinent and timely to my online course’s discussion of past subsistence practices and diets. The students like it when I bring archaeology into the cultural anthropology discussion, because it lets them appreciate how the subfields unite to generate a richer picture and record.After keeping current on research online, I listened in on a 1.5-hour webinar presentation from an astronomer on Maya calendar studies. It gave me some ideas about a project approach I could use in the design process for a new class activity, and was great insight into interdisciplinary research occurring on the other side of the United States from me.Tonight, I look forward to reading through the stack of anthropology/archaeology professional organization journals I put to the side during the spring semester and the ones which arrived while I was at a teaching workshop last week. I might also take a look at my schedule and see if I can get to an archaeology museum this summer to visit an exhibit I would really like to see.While I am teaching one cultural anthropology class online this summer, I use my summers for prepping projects for the upcoming year too. My week included networking with professors at other colleges in my region, including discussing how we can join our students together to learn more about archaeology, and discussing a service learning project with a non-profit director. Moreover, my work included starting to tinker with a conference paper to hopefully have it ready to submit for publication submission soon. I’ve added more sources to my to-read-this-summer book list in hopes of starting plans to design an archaeology course in the next year and activities for a student club which will hopefully be up and running in the next semester. Lastly, my experiences in the midwest last week for a workshop have brought me back to our group website, looking for teaching and anthropology materials I could incorporate into my courses come fall. Although I would like for more hours in each day to be archaeology-focused, I still come back to it often enough for contentment and to enhance my students’ learning experiences.Even though I wasn’t in a field, lab, or in a classroom today, archaeology hasn’t been far from mind or from the independent workload I’ve designed for myself for this summer. It’s always a pleasure to share a bit of the diversity of work opportunities with those interested in archaeology.The Friday Casual: Today’s Brushes with Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"408","by Bernard K. Means, project director, Virtual Curation LaboratoryVCU students Alison Curran and Ian Salata participate in the Day of Archaeology by excavating at Ferry Farm.I chose to spend my Day of Archaeology at George Washington’s Boyhood Home, located in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  Archaeologists working here have uncovered traces of human occupation dating back thousands of years, but understandably have been focused on the period associated with George Washington’s tenancy.  George moved here at the age of 6 with his mother Mary, his father Augustine, and several family members.  A team of archaeologists is working this year–as they have in past years–seeking to broaden our understanding of George Washington’s childhood–a rather poorly documented time period.VCU students Ashley McCuistion and Victoria Garcia look on as the “BW” spoon is being scanned.My goal today is to use my NextEngine scanner and create digital models of archaeological objects recovered at Ferry Farm, including items recovered this year by Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) students as part of their recently completed field school, as well as objects recovered in past years from  contexts definitely associated with the Washington family occupation.  These objects are categorized as “small finds” or unique objects that might be lost in traditional archaeological mass data analyses.  For a recent article on small finds at Ferry Farm, and how they can broaden our understanding of the Washington family’s personal and social worlds, I recommend Ferry Farm archaeologist Laura Galke’s (2009) article “The Mother of the Father of Our Country: Mary Ball Washington’s Genteel Domestic Habits” Northeast Historical Archaeology 38:29-48.  I began the day by scanning a pewter spoon handle with the initials “BW”–representing George Washington’s sister, Betty.  This spoon and its significance for socializing Betty in gentry-class society is discussed by Galke (2009).“BW” spoon as it is being scanned.The spoon actually proved more challenging than expected because it is thin, dark, and the design is shallow.  But, a little fine powder coating and a long scan seems to have resulted in a nice digital model.The second artifact we scanned is a lead alloy cloth seal that resembles late 16th century AD examples from France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. We also scanned a Civil War Minie ball found by VCU student Ian Salata during this year’s field school.  An interesting artifact that we scanned was a toy hatchet made of lead dropped by a tourist visiting the place where some claim (erroneously) that George Washington chopped down the cherry tree!!! The VCU 3D at George Washington’s Boyhood Home by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"409","My day job is in the Department of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum, but today is a day off for me. Not to worry, I’ve found plenty of archaeology, or at least, Cultural Heritage, to keep me occupied! [Since the Institute of Archaeology runs a master’s programme in Cultural Heritage Studies, I thought this would be allowed]Yesterday, the Queen unveiled London’s newest monument, a memorial to the men and women of the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command who gave their lives in service during the Second World War. The event was well attended by veterans and their families, and, coming 67 years after the conclusion of the war, could be regarded as overdue. Today I paid the monument a visit, and attempted to put it in context – amongst other monuments from the war, and also amongst the themes it addresses.The new Bomber Command Memorial, viewed from the approach to the gyratoryThe Bomber Command Memorial is a marble open-topped temple surrounding a bronze sculpture of seven crew members posed as if returning from a missionStatues of crewmen in the Bomber MemorialDoric columns, like the choice of building material, evoke classical values of the virtue of defense that are echoed in a quote from Pericles on the base of the statue. The monument is sited on the Green Park side of a large gyratory at Hyde Park Corner, inside of which are several other large war memorials and the massive Wellington Arch. So, whilst it dominates its corner of the roundabout, the new memorial is not out of place, and I thought if anything it mirrored rather nicely the neo-Classical (though Ionically columned!) entryway into Hyde Park.  The monument also commemorates all of those people from any country who have suffered at the hands of aerial bombing, and in doing so makes a deliberate gesture to those who would criticize any commendation of the efforts of men who wrought such destruction on German cities like Hamburg and Dresden.  This is nice to see, and shows an awareness of the delicateness of the topic, which an earlier memorial did not.  I am referring to the statue of Arthur Harris, the head of Bomber Command during the closing stages of the Second World War, which stands in front of the church of Saint Clement Danes on the Strand.  The statue obviously commemorates the man, but a little plaque on the side also explains that it is erected ‘in memory…of the brave crews of Bomber Command, more than 55,000 of whom lost their lives in the cause of freedom.  The nation owes them all an immense debt.’  According to my little book London’s Monuments by Andrew Kershman (Metro Publications, 2007), when the statue of ‘Bomber’ Harris was unveiled in 1992, the attending crowd booed and threw eggs in disgust.  However much one may make allowances for Harris’ strategy of using his air fleet to attack centres of population (rather than strictly military or industrial targets) by saying that it ultimately helped win the war or was justified in the face of German attacks on British civilians, erecting an oversized statue in his honour was bound to be controversial.What I found fascinating is the evolution of the capital’s commemoration of the RAF’s part in the Second World War over the last half century – and that you can see this evolution on a short walk or bike tour. Starting on the Strand, the church of Saint Clement Danes serves as the official RAF church and a memorial to everyone who has given their life for the force. Gutted in the war, it was reconstructed in the 1950s, and it’s interior is bedecked with plaques, flags and books recalling all of the individuals, units, and battle honours of the RAF. However from the outside the church is rather inconspicuous as a memorial and if anything is only noticeable for its ecclesiastical nature amidst the large buildings of Aldwych. For many years after the war, the more obvious monuments to the RAF would have been those to individuals.Harris’s statue outside the church stands across the forecourt of Saint Clement Danes from another one erected in 1988, of his contemporary Hugh Dowding, who led Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain in 1940.Statue of Lord PortalDown on Embankment, the figures of Lord Portal and Viscount Trenchard, giant figures in the development and leadership of the RAF, have stood watch since the 1960s and 70s.It was only in 2005 that the memorial to the Battle of Britain was constructed on the Embankment opposite Trenchard and Portal. This piece honours the rank and file of the RAF and goes to the effort of listing every person who died during that conflict in 1940. Like the new Bomber Command Memorial, it shows an awareness of the importance of collective effort (and sacrifice) in the achievement of a nation’s prosperity. This isn’t a new phenomenon – witness the many memorials that sprang up after the First World War which gravely paid tribute to ‘the noble dead’. However it is curious to consider that it is only 60 years after the event that London is in a position to feel that the statues of individuals do not pay due respect to the others who served and died for them.I personally thought the new monument was fitting and a poignant reminder of the service of these individuals. Because of the negative associations of carpet bombing German cities, the airmen of Bomber Command have received (to my mind) rather less acknowledgement than they deserve. Certainly they have not been immortalized like their colleagues in Fighter Command, ‘the few’ whom Churchill said we owed so much to.It is interesting to ponder what some future students of material culture will make of the dates and styles of these various monuments to the RAF. I wonder if, when they question why the British felt it proper and necessary to construct a memorial to the 55,000 people from Bomber Command killed in the Second World War, they will reflect on contemporary outrage over British involvement in the Iraq War and the continual disappointment of the campaign in Afghanistan.Poppies and a message left at the Bomber Command MemorialThe Second World War Memorialisation on my Day Off by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"410","Last weekend my left knee decided to stop working. So I had the day off today.  This means doing work for the course I am undertaking alongside my full-time job.I work as the archaeology officer for Southwark Council. Other than staff in the Heritage team who work in the Borough’s museum, I am the only archaeologist at the Council. I work within the Development Management department (we no longer control development, we manage it!). I advise planning officers on whether proposals comply with the requirements of the Borough’s archaeology policy, wider heritage policies and the relevant paragraphs of the National Planning Policy Framework. I issue briefs for archaeological work, check WSIs, monitor site work, check reports, make recommendations for the discharge of archaeological conditions and manage much of the digital data for the department. Along side the archaeological work I also undertake some conservation work where an archaeological input is necessary or valuable or if it is a GIS heavy project.I work in a team with conservation officers, urban design officers and a tree officer. As part of my employer’s commitment to staff training I am currently undertaking a postgraduate diploma in Historic Environment Conservation at the Ironbridge Institute. This is part of the Institute of Antiquity and Archaeology at Birmingham that is currently threatened with closure. Ironbridge is an immensely valuable training organisation that provides recognised degrees and qualifications that are organised in a way whereby those in full-time work can easily undertake the qualification with a minimal level of interference with their full-time jobs.I have nearly finished by essay on concrete conservation (far more interesting than it sounds) and would urge anyone reading this to visit this web page for more information on the potential closure http://saveiaa.wordpress.com/.

"411","Veterans and archaeologists work side-by-side on a daily basis at the Veterans Curation Program (VCP).  Although this is Day of Archaeology 2012, the focus of the VCP is always on the veterans.  Helping these men and women who served our country in the military is our ultimate goal.  In the process, these individuals preserve archaeological collections and associated documentation generated by U.S. Corps of Engineers projects.Many veterans leave their military service wounded and disabled, facing the daunting task of transitioning from the military to civilian life.   They need of a comfortable environment to learn new skills and build confidence as they identify and pursue a career path.  That’s where archaeology comes into the picture.  The staff members of the VCP hire and train veterans who served in all branches of the U.S. military to rehouse and catalog archaeological collections.  A majority of the participants in the program served during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Like so many veterans, some of the participants have experienced Traumatic Brain Injuries and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.   Each day is a new learning experience as the archaeologists teach the veterans about processing the collections, and the veterans teach the archaeologists about their experiences and military culture.   This give-and-take process helps us tailor the program to the needs of these deserving men and women.Founded in 2009, the Veterans Curation Program began to as a way to provide valuable job skills to veterans while preserving culturally significant archaeological collections owned or administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Veteran participants are hired as archaeological laboratory technicians for up to six months and trained extensively on archaeological and collections management principles by archaeologists, archivists, and historians.  Educational lecturers are invited to the laboratories to help the veterans put their contribution into a broader context so that they more fully appreciate our national patrimony and understand the disciplines of archaeology and collections management.There are three VCP laboratory locations: Alexandria, Virginia, Augusta, Georgia, and St. Louis, Missouri.  The staff archaeologists are responsible for having the labs open five days a week.   Schedules are set by veterans to take into account various necessary medical visits and other commitments, such as meetings with counselors and therapists, other employment opportunities, and school schedules for individuals pursuing degrees.  Typically each day, veterans work on stations that include document rehabilitation, artifact processing, data entry, report writing, digital photography of artifacts, and digitization of documents.  This is an abbreviated list of some of the activities that take place in our labs.  Many of the tasks are ones that occur in any ordinary archaeology lab, but the staff also assists veterans with professional growth and development.  Time is allotted for resume writing, job searches, interview practice, and researching possible educational opportunities.  Veterans are also encouraged to attend job fairs and network in the community.Our measures of success are factored on how many veterans have been helped and the amount of collections that have been processed.  The best news is that the Veterans Curation Program has trained and employed 102 veterans as of this post.   Of the veterans who have completed the program, 82% are successfully employed and/or continuing their education in various degree programs.  In terms of the collections, over 51 linear feet of archives and 669 boxes of artifacts have been rehabilitated.  A digital collection is being created with the intent to eventually make data available online to researchers, educators, and the public.  To learn more about the VCP, please visit our website at www.VeteransCurationProgram.org.The U.S. Military Veterans Contribute to Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"412","Hello I’m Cornelius, one of the partners at L – P: Archaeology. I’ve been doing commercial archaeology for 25 years now, and I know that the following short story will be very familiar to a lot of you, but anyone who has never been involved in a trenching evaluation be warned- this rollercoaster ride of thrills, despair and elation is not for the faint hearted. Some images may contain brickearth.As described in my earlier post, we are currently conducting a 5% sample evaluation below a car-park in Egham, Surrey. First thing this morning we broke the tarmac on a fresh new trench, full of possibilities. We started to machine away the modern overburden deposits below the surface, taking care to avoid the large water pipe we knew to be in the trench. As our very skilled machine driver was doing this I got a call from another site.51 miles away to the south lies the lovely house of Brambletye in Keston. An extension is currently being built on the house, which involves digging some small but deep footings. As the house lies next to the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Keston Roman Tombs, even very small scale work needs to be watched closely, so I leave the trench in the capable hands of my colleague Mike and zoom off down the M25.When I get to Brambletye the crew have a small 3-ton digger ready, and have soon dug the footing. There is absolutely nothing in it but natural clay, with not even a stray sherd of Roman pot in the topsoil. My disappointment is offset by a very fine cup of tea, and then back to Egham to look at the trench.In my absence Mike has cleaned and recorded the trench beautifully. A single linear feature in the trench has been sectioned, and is clearly a wall footing of early 20th century origin- possibly the wall of the doctors surgery we were told about by the very helpful staff at Egham Museum, who were kind enough to show us their collection of old maps. There is no other archaeology visible in the trench, so I survey it using a Smartrover GPS system and we fill it back in. I lock up the site and head home to write up the days results. Which are that I have driven about 150 miles, shifted a few hundred tons of earth and found nothing of archaeological interest whatsoever.But it was mostly sunny, and I was out in the fresh air, and I got a close look at a very cool Roman tomb complex. And the tea was very good.					#gallery-1 {				margin: auto;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-item {				float: left;				margin-top: 10px;				text-align: center;				width: 50%;			}			#gallery-1 img {				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;			}			#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {				margin-left: 0;			}																								This chap driving was very skilled, and I’d have liked to say thanks here but he asked me not to post his name on the internet.

"414","For many years I would be on my way to Egypt at this time of year, trying to figure out how to stretch the grant money to cover as much time in the field as possible. But this year I’m in my research lab at the university, working on the final stages of several projects.As an archaeology student I discovered that I was mainly interested in the people themselves, rather than their garbage. So my specialization is in human skeletal remains (bioarchaeology). I’m particularly interested in how human skeletons reveal aspects of the interrelationships between culture, environment, and health. I have excavated ancient cemeteries in Egypt and Pakistan, and have studied human skeletal remains from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley Civilization, and from historic cemeteries of the Fur Trade Period in western Canada.A 2,000 year old cemetery in Egypt.Today I’m examining 2,000 year old human bones and teeth for evidence of fractures and various forms of disease.Tuberculosis in the spine.Usually there are one or two interesting or important discoveries made in the field, but often the significance of your work isn’t clear until you’ve had a chance to examine all of the finds and to determine where they fit in the big picture of the site, and of the ancient culture more broadly. That process usually takes years!I also study the historic and prehistoric ways in which people dealt with their dead. With this research I don’t excavate, but instead I examine the above-ground and archival record of historic cemeteries in western Canada in order to assess the fit between archaeological interpretive models for prehistoric cemeteries and the documented evidence for burial practices.If you’d like to learn more about my research, please check the website on my profile.The Excavation & Skeletal Analysis by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"415","Today I am putting the finishing touches on a grant application in order to get money to do some digging at a site in Ireland called Dun Ailinne. This site dates to about 2000 years ago, and tells us important things about life in Ireland during the Iron Age. We are applying to the National Science Foundation in the United States to get money so we can go and dig at the site over the next two summers. Digging can be expensive because we have to buy the tools and other equipment we need, get people to the site, and get them food to eat and a place to stay while we are digging. Describing what we want to do and why we want to do it is the easy part. Figuring out how much money we want and explaining how we are going to spend it is trickier! I just had to write something about why it is we need to rent portable toilets while we are on the site. You’d think that would be obvious!Even though I’m not in the field doing research, it’s still fun to think about what I want to do and plan how I want to do it. I really like my job! But I need to get back to writing and planning. The grant is due July 1 so we only have a few days left to finish.

"416","This year’s Day of Archaeology falls during the first half of the field season of the Brown University Petra Archaeological Project (BUPAP). Managed by the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, BUPAP is a multi-disciplinary research project that hopes to understand the development of Petra and its surrounding landscapes diachronically, both through regional survey and excavation at individual sites.The Petra Area and Wadi Silaysil Survey in action (Photo by Linda Gosner).Portrayals of Petra have historically focused on the monumental city- images of the Siq, the royal tombs, the Treasury, and the Great Temple imbedded into popular culture through the likes of Indiana Jones and countless other representations. BUPAP looks to build upon this past research and public interest, to contextualize our understanding of Petra’s diversity, and to ask new questions of the city and its surroundings including periods and places that have generally received little academic attention. Our fieldwork is split into four interrelated projects: the Petra Upper Market Area (PUMA) involves excavation, geophysical survey, and architectural studies in the city center; the Petra Area and Wadi Silaysil Survey (PAWS) is an intensive and systematic regional survey focused on the area north of the city; the Bayda Islamic Village (BIV) features excavation and mapping of an Islamic settlement; and the Petra Routes Project (PRP) investigates local and regional communication and travel. These are four diverse and exciting projects which we hope will bring some new ideas to the study of the city.Our excavation team hard at work.The diversity of both the site and the project is also represented in our project team. We’re lucky to work with an international group of established scholars, graduate students, and professional architects from the US, Jordan, Malta, Canada, Italy, Germany, Colombia, and Macedonia. We also rely on strong ties to the local community to understand the site in both its ancient and modern context. Besides the obvious academic benefits of such a broad range of contributors, our international team also makes for a lively and enjoyable workday and dig house.Since Friday is our day off, we don’t have much to report from site today- you can check out posts by our team members Andy Dufton or Allison Mickel to learn more about what our team gets up to during the break.

"417","New Zealand Archaeological Association 2012 Conference Field TripThe conference this year is being held in Oamaru in New Zealand’s South Island.  Two bus loads of archaeologists went on the field trip today - coincidentally the Day of Archaeology – it is a feature of every annual conference run by the Association.There is information about the Association and the conference including a programme here:www.nzarchaeology.orghttp://nzarchaeology.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=66:conference-2012&Itemid=60&layout=defaultThe conference programme and abstracts can be downloaded here. Inspecting the Awamoko shelter site Oamaru is renowned in New Zealand for its architecture. It had early wealth from its fine agricultural land, first in exporting grain but later from other crops, and pastoral farming. The wealth of the town in the late 1800s was reflected in its classical architecture. The buildings utilised a local white limestone – Oamaru stone, which was valued for building here and elsewhere in Australia and New Zealand One of the buildings in OamaruThe area is also rich in prehistoric sites. Early Maori sites occur at river and estuary mouths. They commonly have the bones of New Zealand giant extinct birds, moa, but also other birds, marine mammals and fish exploited by the first residents.The most notable prehistoric sites in the area are the rock art sites that occur in overhang shelters and caves along the valleys in, and at the margins of the limestone. These date from the whole of Maori occupation and into the contact period where settler items also appear.Out field trip visited a number of these sites, on a cold clear day, where there was fresh snow on the adjacent hills. We were guided by Maori manawhenua (people of the land) Ngai Tahu who have an active programme in preserving and studying these sites. Brian Allingham who works with them and has long studied them talked at each of the five sites visited as did Amanda Symon, curator of the Ngai Tahu Maori Rock Art Trust. They requested that any website use of images has their approval. As a consequence it is only the social views that appear here, but there are many images on the web – see the links.The images we saw in the sites we went to included a spiral carved into the rock and drawings of people, dogs and animal forms. At other sites there are pictures of birds, canoes and many decorative elements.Entering a decorated shelterThe Te Ana rock art museum in Timaru is a great place to start a visit to the area http://www.teana.co.nz/  It is run by the Maori manawhenua, Ngai Tahu.Some more information on rock art can be found here and here and here and here.A google search for images can be made hereAmanda Symon – one of our guidesShelter near DuntroonThe buses near DuntroonWalking between sites in the limestone outcropsSnow on the Southern Alps foothills The last stop on the trip was at Otekaieke. This is a grand estate house built in the Scottish manorial style by an immigrant Scot, Robert Campbell. He imported Scots craftsmen to assist in its construction. It is one of a number of like estates in the South Island built on wool wealth. Huge sheep runs were the locations of all these estates. It was only occupied as a house for a few years before Campbell died young, followed shortly after by his widow. They had no descendants. It was subsequently part of the series of estates broken up around 1900 under Government pressure to create more land for small farmers. The home and site was later a boy’s reformatory school but went out of that use and is now privately owned. The gardens are now much degraded and the site cluttered with a diverse range of more modern buildings dating from the school use. Otekaieke – Robert Campbell’s great estate The New Zealand Historic Places Trust register entries for the house and the associated stables can be seen here:http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=4378http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=4377There is more about the station history  here.A fuller set of pictures from the trip can be seen here on facebook.The site locations are here on Google Maps The New Zealand Archaeological Association 2012 Conference Fieldtrip by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"418","You can’t put down a good read. Still going through my pile of references and finding more on the Internet.  There is a fascinating policy context for engaging young people in archaeology. It’s frustrating that archaeology hasn’t really engaged with the wider debate about young people. I can hold myself partly responsible for this as I was the Head of Education at the CBA, and was with the CBA for 17 years. I now think I spent far too much time sitting on committees and being concerned about the school curriculum. Ah well. There are plenty of good people in archaeology working with young people and I’m sure that greater political awareness will come about without me worrying about it.I do think we’re far to insular in the UK and don’t look internationally enough at the good work going on elsewhere. How many here know of the World Heritage Education Programme?One depressing statistic I’ve picked up today. 77% of media reports about young people are negative or unfavourable and that becomes 83% in broadcast media. I wish the media could see some of the work of the Young Archaeologists’ Club. It might open their eyes – but then they won’t want to see it as bad news is always more newsworthy it seems.Right – time for chocolate.The Evening and More Creative Thoughts by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"419","My Day of Archaeology began with a trip to the local historical society. I delivered two boxes of artifacts and a report that detailed the weekend excavation conducted with my Intro Archaeology class right in their back yard.Grammes Brown House in Tiffin, Ohio – Headquarters of the Tiffin Historic TrustAs usual, the historical society folks were a bit skeptical that we would find “anything” but we sure did.Some of the artifacts recovered from the Grammes Brown House. Ceramics, bones from steaks, a doll leg, and the corner of a toilet bowl tank.After I left the historical society, I made a similar delivery to the archives of the college where I have been teaching for the last four years. The oldest building on campus is an 1852 octagon shaped house and I spent three days excavating there with an honors course called “The Power of Place.”Octagon House – located on the campus of Heidelberg UniversityAgain we uncovered a lot more than anyone imagined, including the remains of a greenhouse that was attached to the octagon around 1900. The artifacts here were very different from those at the Grammes Brown house, which makes sense. Although both houses were built and occupied around the same time, the people living in the Grammes Brown house were wealthier than those who lived at the Octagon.Some of the artifacts recovered from the Octagon House. A metal thimble, two buttons (glass and shell), a fragment of slate pencil, a plastic checker piece, and a fragment of a large milk pan.The archaeology of historic houses helps to bring community history to life. The students who worked on these excavations learned as much about their new hometown as they did about archaeology.Anyone interested in learning more about these excavations can find a copy of the full report here. Paper copies of the report will be on file at the Ohio Historical Society, the Tiffin Historic Trust, and Heidelberg University.The rest of my Day of Archaeology is being spent preparing for new projects in New York.

"420","The Archaeology of Archaeology Quite often we are engaged with something which later becomes our profession. As time goes by we are seized by the obligations and responsibilities of our profession so that forget why we choose the one which models our life. Whether we have done it because we love the activities related to the specified profession, we believe in its contribution to improving the world or simply have decided to deal with something because it brings us earnings or prestige in society? Particularly The Day of Archeology gives an opportunity once archaeologists to rethink their motives and wonder why we started to deal with archeology. Any of our responses will guide us to answer the question what archeology is about us and how it is seen in the eyes and minds of those who are not archaeologists. Therefore, regardless of our individual motives to become archaeologists and (not)objective reasons to stay still archaeologists, however most agree about our understanding of archeology and its objectives. Archaeology is a science i.e. scientific discipline that officially exists for only three centuries. Although in the past millennia there was consistent tendency to comprehend the past, yet the first archaeologists with Bachelor appear very late, even in the 18th century. However, in comparison with many other social and natural sciences, the later institutionalization of archeology is just formalizing what thousands of years is one of the most existential human issues – the past. Man has always had an interest in what happened in the past and how it contributes in creation of the present. And particularly in the answers to this question, archeology is considered as the most competent, especially due to its possibility to have direct insight into what people left behind. Despite other sciences that considers distant past, the archeology has the privilege directly to penetrate into the items as they were and not like others had wrote and spoke about them. Perhaps such a privilege for a forensic understanding of the past is the motive that stimulates archaeologists to be attracted by the possibility for a voyeuristic glimpse into ancient cultures. Surely, such scientific voyeurism as much it is exciting that much it bears responsibility, mostly in the interpretation of the function and significance of objects and buildings in the past.  Interpretation is actually the essence of archeology, from which emerges the greatest responsibility of archaeologists as the official interpreters of the past. Archaeologists are not adventurists which digs the fields and hills or distributors of artifacts for embellishment of collectors and governors. Yes, there were any and there are some still, but most of us feel the responsibility to thoroughly examine and understand the past cultures and through argumented interpretation to share our knowledge. Although there are enormous temptations for personal glory and creating national policies through artifacts, yet we remain consistent to our responsibility with arguments to interpret the past and present as a cultural heritage. The hours spent under the blazing sun on sites or inside wet museum storages make us stronger in the determination of comprehensive understanding of the human past, as well as in its explanation to people today. Therefore, a day in honor of archeology reminds us of our scientific ethics and confront us with the challenges and responsibilities we have for a current and future generations. In a way, it brings us back to the initial motives why we became archaeologists. The desire to know the past and thoroughly to talk about it is the urge that stimulated us to be persistent in our choice and intention to contribute to the understanding of the millennia of humanity changes and achievements. We believe that this urge will still keeps us in our scientific endeavors and will further stimulate the sharing of our knowledge of Macedonian and World cultural heritage. Macedonian Archaeological and Scientific Association The Day of Archaeology in Macedonia 2 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"421"," Today you’re going to read lots of great and interesting posts about what we do when we are in the field and lab, but I want to show a bit more than that. I want to take you out of the Field, out of the Lab, and into a place of magic and wonder! I want to show you the world of the Archaeological Office!Seriously! I am currently doing an internship with the DHPA here in Indiana. For those who don’t know the DHPA stands for the Department of Historical Preservation and Archaeology. I do quite a bit of a variety of things. I’ve been in the woods looking for prehistoric artifacts, I’ve been in the lab labeling artifacts, but mostly I’ve been in the office, learning GIS and an awesome new system called SHAARD.SHAARD and GIS are great for a geeky-chick like me. I’ve got a soft spot for computers, and I’ve been fascinated with GIS ever since one of my coworkers took a picture of his cat and made a 3D Topo-map out of it. It was cool. SHAARDSHAARD’s main page with a drop down menu showing selectionsSHAARD stands for The Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database. (It’s the government, they love alphabet soup.) This database is open and searchable by the public, except for the archaeological records. Now what does that get the average person? Well, you can search cemeteries, Historical theaters, anything on the National Register, Historical Bridges, and the County Surveys. Check it out, you don’t have to do anything to search and access records.                                                                     One of several images in SHAARD for the historical Indiana TheaterIf you are a professional, you can apply to receive access to the archaeological part of the data base, which is where I come in. I am one of a team who are busily inputting data from hand written field and site reports into the online database. This is  a whole lot more intresting than it sounds, and sometimes a little more difficult.Just a tip to the field people, other people have to read your handwriting…just saying…SHAARD is a bit groundbreaking with all it’s trying to do. It’s unique to the State of Indiana, and it is attempting to be the most complete searchable database out there. It is currently focused on connecting the site information to a massive GIS map of the entire state. When we get done, not only will you be able to log in and see all the data collected so far, you’ll see a list of artifacts, references, descriptions, vital contact information, and maps. When you click though, it will take to you a usable GIS map with photo overlay. No more guessing.I was ecstatic when I found out this last bit, and I will admit, I’m very picky about point and polygon placement on the map. I know what it’s like to be out there in the field with a Tremble “guessing” about where the site really is. I’ve been there, I’ve dug those empty holes, marched that extra half mile, been lost in that wood. I get it.I’m also picky because this is what I’ve decided to get my masters in. GIS is becoming vital to our field. Not just for mapping, but other excellent uses…like making Topo’s of your cat pictures…or artifact density analysis, you know, whatever is more important.DHPA and CemeteriesThe DHPA is also responsible for locating and recording cemeteries in the state. I don’t just mean the easy to find ones like beautiful Crown Hill, I mean tiny, probably forgotten, no-tombstone having, cemeteries too. One of my fist projects at the DHPA was to help defined the boarders of a small, neglected cemetery. It turned out, I already knew quite a bit about the cemetery because I’d done work on two sites connected to it already.I won’t lie, I spent a fair amount of time in the State Library going over old records, newspaper clippings, city histories, and Sanborn maps on micro film. (Not a fan of microfilm). I’m a bit of a research nut, so this was pretty cool, and I got goofy excited when we went to the State Records Archives  and look at the 1930/40′s aerial photography looking for my little cemetery.  Sadly, I never did find it, but sometimes this happens.                                                                                        John Walters and a cleaned headstoneNow you all know I’m big with the public outreach and all that, and I was really happy to find out that one of the things the DHPA does is works with our local Historical Foundation to host Cemetery workshops. They host a two-day long class where people come and learn how to restore and preserve the cemeteries around the state. They work with John Walters, an expert in cemetery restoration, to teach people how to clean, repair, and restore tombstones. They also provide lectures on how to identify features of the tombstones, what kind of stone they are, and how to use SHAARD. A local geologist showing how to identify types of stone used in headstone production.The class also has an advanced component where you can become certified to probe in the state. See, there are laws that control when and how you can dig on land that isn’t your own. In Indiana you can become certified to probe with a solid body probe in order to look for buried tombstones. DHPA is also involved in a little thing called National Archaeology Month, where each year they put on numerous workshops and day camps, bringing archaeology to the public. I’m also going to be involved with those.So, yah, I’m not bushwhacking though greenfield in 100+ degree weather, fighting for my life against mosquitoes and ticks right now. I am making life a little easier for those who are, and extending archaeology to the public little by little. I like to think this end of archaeology is just as interesting as the survey and recovery end, I know it’s just as vital. In the end, I’m having as much fun here as I’ve ever had in the field, and I know having done the full gambit allows me to understand what people in the field need from those in the office. I feel like I am bridging a gap, for the time being, and when the time comes and I’m out in the field again, I’ll understand more about why the Tremble hate us.The Archaeology Doesn’t End in the Lab, It’s Got an Office Too by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"422","Today, 31 children from North Duffield Community Primary School conducted a dig on the school playing fields. 3 test pits of 1x1m were dug by the children in groups of 10,10,and 11. As each group of 10(11) were digging , the remainder were washing finds from earlier field-walking We suffered sharp showers and high winds which challenged the stability of the gazebos erected to protect them.At 12cms below ground level they encounteresd a dirty sand deposit with few inclusions although some charcoal and granules of what appeared to be cbm, were present. At 35cms plain yellow sand with no inclusions was found suggesting that natural had been encountered. The dig was more about introducing the children to live archaeology and the discipline of digging rather than what we found.They thoroughly enjoyed there day, excited the interest of younger children who were keen to get involved and were impatient to have to wait for their turn nexct year.Supported by the presence of Dr Jon Kenny of York Archaeological Trust, this was Community Archaeology at its best.The Big School Dig 2012 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"423"," Greetings from the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, a division of the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois-Champaign! Recently, I have been spending my days in the lab helping to update and transcribe site inventories into a digital database.  The excavations that produced these artifacts were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, and the only inventories that exist are on hard copy.  Additionally, some of the artifacts are still in their original paper collection bags.  I am currently relabeling and rebagging artifacts, mostly lithics, and entering catalogue and provenience information into a digital database.  (Provenience refers to the exact location on the site at which the artifact was found; as opposed to the “Antiques Roadshow” term provenance, which refers to the entire history of the object from its discovery to the present).  It is important to curate these items using materials and technology that will help to preserve both the artifacts and their associated provenience information. While this task might not entail bullwhip-cracking excitement and Spielberg-worthy finds, I think it is every bit as valuable as the discovery of a new site, the excavation of a unique artifact, or the ground-breaking research taking place daily.  This is due in part to my recent completion of a Master’s thesis in which I analyzed artifacts from the Chesapeake Bay region, despite living about 800 miles away in the Midwest.  I was able to conduct a majority of my research and some data collection using the Comparative Archaeological Study of Colonial Chesapeake Culture database (http://www.chesapeakearchaeology.org/index.cfm), created by the Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory and other Chesapeake archaeologists and collaborators.  This information was available to me thanks to the careful curation and meticulous inventorying of thousands of artifacts by Tidewater archaeologists in Maryland and Virginia. As I work on curating the artifacts and information from excavations conducted years ago in Illinois, my recent research experience is always in the back of my mind.  I hope that our careful curation of the artifacts from decades-old excavations will assist researchers investigating these sites to more easily access this information.  The field of archaeology continues to advance both technologically and theoretically, and it is important to preserve artifacts and information as completely as possible to assist future researchers in the reinvestigation and reanalysis of previously-excavated sites.  Who knows what exciting reinterpretations might someday be based on these nondescript bags of broken rocks?These chert samples were collected from a site investigated in the 1960s and 1970s. The Zen and the Art of Curation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"424","My Day of Archaeology, is, as it was last year, meta.  I am one of the founders of the Day of Archaeology project, and I have spent my day (mostly) online, editing and posting articles and Tweeting about the project.  This is pretty much as good as my Day of Archaeology is going to get.  The loosest relationship my day had to field archaeology was when I went to see my back specialist this morning about a back injury I exacerbated last year when I was digging in Poland -  I went a bit mental with the de-turfing and hurt my back so badly I had to return to the UK and missed out on working on the most amazing 14th C. Baltic site.A pal on Twitter said to me yesterday that I was mud-avoidant.  I will be the first to admit that what  I do for my PhD isn’t exactly archaeology.  I am a PhD student at the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, and my research is ‘Public Archaeology in a Digital Age’.  So I’m looking at how, where and why archaeology and the public meet online and how archaeology as a sector creates, sustains and uses online community.  There are a few things that keep me awake at night about my research, mainly because it’s just so damn fascinating.  At the moment, I am researching the concept of archaeological authority and knowledge-ownership -  I think that  changes to the landscape of communication in archaeology are simply a technologically-facilitated continuation of longer-term developments within the sector as a whole (get me).  But  how far has the growth of participatory media impacted the archaeological sector in the UK?  How have these media facilitated collaboration between professional and layperson? Has the encouragement of audience participation gone any way towards supporting any real acknowledgement of multi-vocal approaches to heritage issues? What evidence exists that social media dialogue is about sharing archaeological authority at all, in an online context?  Which part these ‘non-professional’ digital voices will be considered inauthentic, and why?  So many questions…I do a lot of research through surveys, and talking to people, but a lot of my work is also observation.  How people interact, what is said, how it is said, where it’s said.. so today has been interesting!  I absolutely love my PhD topic and feel hugely privileged to be funded to undertake it.  I get to read lots of sociology, which is my new Best Thing, and I have learned so much by being part of the Centre for Digital Humanities, and the interdisciplinarity there.   It has been the most interesting 2 years of my life ever (and I’ve had some interesting years, believe me)..  I just hope someone will employ me at the end of all this, the big worry for every PhD student.I have recently moved back home to East Anglia, mainly because it’s cheap, but mostly for some peace and quiet.  The flat, open landscape here created the archaeologist inside me (she really ought to get out more, poor girl).  The wealth of wool churches, the Norman castles, the shadows of Norse in the dialect, and the Scandinavian street names led me to study medieval archaeology 21 years ago, and although I am all about archaeology and communication, AD 400 – 900 is my secret passion.  But if anyone asks, I’m strictly social media & comms, right?  Right?For us Public Archaeologists, understanding how we meet, discuss and inform the public and understanding the technologies we can use to do this is, I think, vital.  I just hope that my research outcomes will play a small part in having an impact on how archaeology exploits Internet technologies.  Part of this understanding is the development of the Day of Archaeology itself.  I am overwhelmed by the support we have been offered by archaeologists worldwide, for free, for the love of archaeology, because we believe it matters, not just for ourselves but everyone. That we have managed all this through the power of the Internet is witness to the increasing importance of Public Archaeology at a time when archaeology is being given the death of a thousand cuts.  Without public support, we will wither.Better get writing then, eh?The Mud-Avoidance by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"425","Hello from Chiswick in West London, where the sun has finally come out and it’s all systems go in the Current Publishing office.My name’s Carly – I’m the Editorial Assistant for Current Archaeology and Current World Archaeology, and as it’s the Day of Archaeology today I thought I’d take you behind the scenes to see how the magazines are put together.Friday is treats day at Current Publishing, and today the morning got off to a very promising start with advertising maestro Mike earning literal brownie points by bringing in some baked goodies for us to share. We’re always excited when cake arrives in the office, and with one team birthday yesterday and two more imminent, there’s a lot of it about.Right now we’re slap-bang in the middle of the press cycle. Our sister magazine Military History Monthly was sent to the printers yesterday, so today the full might of the design team has switched over to CWA, which is the next to go (in July).Designer Justine is currently working her magic on the culture section, making our museum and book reviews look fabulous, while Art Editor Mark is experimenting with options for the next cover. At the moment we have 10 separate designs stuck up on the wall, which certainly brightens things up a bit!CWA Editor Caitlin is putting the finishing touches to the last couple of features that are going into the next issue (#54), giving them a last polish before they are signed off as ‘ready to lay out’, while CA Editor Matt is out in the field, visiting an excavation at Oakington in Cambridgeshire where some seriously spectacular Anglo-Saxon burials are being uncovered. We covered the site in CA 261, and it’s fantastic to see that there are more stories to reveal. Watch this space for more information in CA 270!Meanwhile, our boss Rob is tinkering with the ‘Flatplan’, doing clever things to the system we use to plan the layout of each issue, track the progress of articles and generally organise our lives, and our intern Roseanna is lending a hand with the news section, hunting for breaking stories all over the world. We’re always grateful for another pair of hands in the office, and it’s such fun sharing what media archaeology is all about with people who are as passionate about the past as we are.This is the great thing about working at Current Publishing – we’re a small team but everyone has a unique and important role to play, and every day is different. Although I work for both magazines, because of where we’re at in the schedule I’ve been mostly focussing on CWA today. It’s great fun jumping between UK and international stories.This morning I finished a two-page article about a site in Peru and wrote a fact box about Phrygians for a feature on Turkey, while this afternoon I’ve been sourcing pictures and turning around a breaking news story about World Heritage Sites for the CWA website.Much like digging, you never know quite what each day is going to bring – but that’s what makes it so exciting.Find out more – you can find Current Archaeology on Facebook here, or follow us on Twitter at @currentarchaeo.Current World Archaeology’s Facebook page is here, and we tweet as @worldarchaeo. The Behind the scenes at Current Publishing by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"426","It’s not my table, but you get the idea. Photo: Guy Hunt. My Day of Archaeology began early, over tea and toast at my kitchen table. Having another archaeologist as a house guest has been a great excuse for extended breakfast table discussions on the meaning of (archaeological) life, the universe and everything. I have this pet theory that some of our best and most productive work takes place around the kitchen table, sometimes that might be in the form of a heated debate or at other times, after wiping down the breadcrumbs and spreading out a map or a matrix diagram, it might be in the form of analysis and writing.Cutting to the business end of this blog entry: what did I do today on this Day of Archaeology? Emails responded, check. Reports printed and sent out to the Local Planning Authority, check. Discussion with other partners about the current state of our projects, check. Clients chased up for payment, check (but no cheque).I wanted to be honest and write this blog about my actual day today. I didn’t want to dress it up too much and make out that everyday is an endless series of incredible discoveries and eureka moments. Sometimes, the less than glamorous truth is that this job is actually just a job. Running a small archaeology business requires a lot of patience. For every project I do that results in a great find or a fantastic publication, there are countless hours spent organising, negotiating, networking, politicking and generally administering things.So, although in a way this was “just another day at the office”, it was much more than that, it was a series of tiny steps leading toward the next joyful piece of fieldwork, it was a day of trying to put all of my ongoing projects into the same forward direction.I have got a really exciting fieldwork project programmed in for August, when hopefully we will be digging test pits into part of London’s city ditch. At the moment the project is in that tricky stage of getting everything set up and ready to go. I need to get my Written Scheme of Investigation into this evening’s post (with a little bit of help from one of my lovely partners) and we need to get staff sorted out and programmed in, we need to get all our logistics in place as well as our health and safety assessments and 101 other vital details. There is also some all important day dreaming to be done about how great this project is going to be and what different technologies (such as ARK) that we can trial on the project.Hopefully, if I can get through all that, this afternoon I can also get a few more of these small steps done on that fieldwork write up project that has been on my conscience since January.To all of the other archaeologists in the libraries, archaeology offices, laboratories, site huts and kitchen tables of the world, I salute you.———-Guy Hunt is a Partner in L – P : Archaeology a UK based commercial archaeology (CRM) company.

"427","As ‘Day of Archaeology 2012′ sprung into life, the excavations on the Iron Age Caerleon 2012 dig came to a close. This is our final day of a brisk five day project. At the moment it’s about 8:15 in the morning, and I am looking out towards the University of Wales, Newport campus. There are clouds, lots of them, and they are not the fluffy light ones, they have a pretty foreboding look about them… The campus is roughly a twenty minute drive from our excavation site, and our team this year has been dependent on our committed core of undergraduates. I should clarify that these are history undergraduate students, rather than archaeology undergraduates. Time was, our university had a bustling and well respected archaeology department, but for a variety of reasons, we sadly lost that department, and history was left standing alone. However, there are enough of us archaeologists who survive in and near to the university, and the desire for archaeological research stands strong, even if we don’t have the name ‘archaeology’ on our department notice board anymore. A strong tenant of our excavations in the past was to train prospective field archaeologists, and that has been seen again this year, with the majority of the team being made up of first time archaeologists.You would not know to look at them, but all five of the team members here are on their very first field excavation. The excavations this year are just below an Iron Age hillfort (Lodge Hill), which overlooks the Roman fortress at Caerleon. We’ve been following up on a number of features, and today we are focusing on the second of our two sites, the excavation of a trackway feature. We have some great maps that suggest the length of the trackway to be pretty significant, and running in a temptingly straight line (tempting if you like Roman features that is), going straight over the top of the hillfort. Lots of questions were being asked of this feature, how was it made, how old was it, what was it used for? As the final day of our excavations proceed, hopefully we’ll be able to deal with some of those queries.The trackway.(…several hours later…)Well, back home now, 6pm(ish), in the warmth of the office, feet up and in front of the computer. Those black clouds spied earlier gave as expected, and turned the majority of our ‘day of archaeology’, into a day of mini trench floods and occasional soakings. Such is the way with field archaeology. That though is not to say that our last day of excavation was in any way a negative, in fact we had quite a successful day.First things first though, for many of the entries posted for Day of Archaeology, we have been treated to some stunning artefacts and insights. Alas, the most time consuming activity that took place on our final day, was, as is often the case for field excavation, back filling! It’s one of those questions that is often asked of us by passing visitors, ‘what are you going to do with it (the archaeology) once you’ve finished?’, the standard short answer is ‘fill it in’. So for our day in the life of an archaeologist, it was a day of hole filling, more so than it was for hole excavation (although it’s not always a dull affair as these keen excavators hopefully show)!As some of the trenches were being filled in though, we had sunk two test pit sections through our trackway feature, which previously in the week had revealed two distinct surfaces, and in the last hour or so of the day, revealed a third. Coming down on a really compact clay surface (you can see the moment when it was revealed here), the most obvious inclusion was a wealth of charcoal material.The discovery of this surface was one of the last acts of archaeology on site for the year. However, the questions go on. Dating from the charcoal will be next on the agenda. We only returned a few sherds of probably post medieval pottery (though it might be late, you never know) from the first two surfaces, but the charcoal may well let us take our site back much further, we’ll have to wait and see. When we do get the results though, that should go a long way to helping us tackle some of those many questions we had going into this, so it’s a great result, even if the result means that we must wait on some more results.And so as the day of archaeology ends, so does our excavation. It’s been a blast being involved in field archaeology again after some time away, but as interesting as the excavation element has been, today, as with the rest of this week has reminded me of one thing in particular. Field excavation has a funny effect on people. There is something about going through the hours of excavation, be it in sunshine or rain, be it through the excitement of discovering a road surface untouched for however many centuries, or the frustration of sifting through yet another find free ditch (two of our team know what that is all about now), that brings people together. At the start of this week, we had probably four distinct groups of people, different backgrounds, different social groups, different interests, yet spending the week sharing the experience of field excavation, those barriers gradually whittled away. Those involved became friends, became united, and that is both a surprising but also familiarly reassuring thing about field excavation. At the end of it all, we had had a wonderful time, become good friends, and ultimately, we were united as archaeologists. Here’s hoping your day of archaeology was as good as ours! The Making Archaeologists.

"430","Today has been a pretty normal day in my current archaeological life. I am in the final year of my PhD and so have been battling away infront of a laptop (like many others) trying to make sense of archaeological data and say something new and interesting about the past.I am lucky in that I live in Cambridge, and so had a lovely cycle ride this morning across the meadows, past the cows, to install myself into the Cambridge University Library (UL). This is one of the joys of being a student in the UK, even though I am doing my PhD at UCL in London I am more than welcome to come and use the library in Cambridge for free which is not only great for books – it also has an excellent tea room.Bronze Age Huts in QGISMy PhD is on the Bronze Age hut settlements on Bodmin Moor, I am using Augmented Reality to examine the locations of the huts and how they fit into the landscape. This involves a lot of GIS work and also some 3D modelling. I have a lovely GIS dataset of the Bronze Age hut locations and a pretty decent elevation model. When out in the field archaeologists use quite few tools, but the trowel is probably the most useful. When in front of the computer archaeologists also use a lot of tools – today I was using the Python framework to script a way to get GRASS data into blender so that I could load virtual models of the huts into Unity3D to view them in my ARK database to then finally use Vuforia and Unity3D to display it in the real world. Today my most useful tool is Textmate.Bodmin Moor in blenderBasically what I am trying to do is import 2D GIS data into a 3D gaming engine, that I can then use to explore the data and (using Augmented Reality) ‘overlay’ that onto the real world. The important thing is to ensure the spatial coordinates are preserved when it is imported into the gaming engine – otherwise the on-site GPS location won’t work during the Aug. Reality stage. So the distances, heights and topography seen int he gaming engine representation are as close to the real world as possible (at least the real as modelled in the GIS!). To keep track of the huts and their associated data I have been using the ARK database system (created by Day of Archaeology sponsors  L – P : Archaeology). ARK brings all of the various bits together  – data from the literature, basic dimensions of the huts, spatial data and also the 3D representation. I’ve been getting some pretty good results from my experiments and seem to have cracked the workflow – I’ll put up a proper walkthrough on my blog once the script is all sorted out as I think it will probably be pretty useful for others to see and use. In the meantime I have made a very small screencast to show the huts within ARK and Unity – which I think it pretty cool. For those of a techy bent, ARK is sending the Unity3D plugin the id of the hut currently being viewed and Unity is then figuring out where that hut is in the virtual world and placing the ‘player’ inside it.Wow that was all a bit techy – sorry about that!So as promised in the title of the post then – here is a link to some wrestling pythons…and someone blending grass..and the paper proofing is a bit more boring…Today I also approved the final author proofs of an article on my research that is going to be published in Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory. Apparently when they have made my suggested corrections (c. 1 week) it should be available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10816-012-9142-7  for people who have personal or institutional subscriptions to the journal, very exciting!Right back to the coding… only an hour before I get chucked out of the library. The Wrestling Pythons, Blending Grass and Proofing Papers by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"431","Much of archaeology, especially in academia, comes down to how you spend your summer vacation. After finishing up the first year of a PhD at the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World at Brown University, this summer I’ve been making the project circuit in Italy and Jordan, the latter as part of the Brown University Petra Archaeological Project.Today was the day off for the team, and met with a slow start after a late night of football and dancing under the stars on the roof of the dig house (aka Club Sayhoun). Day off or no day off, five of us were up early and ready for a six hour hike to Jebel Harun, the grave of Aaron (Arabic: Harun), brother of Moses. And what a hike it was- you can all check out Allison’s post detailing just why visiting the tomb has been a pilgrimage for almost two thousand years. To add to her sparkling narrative would hardly do it justice, so instead I’m going to focus on the archaeologists with whom I spent the day hiking to the top of the known Petra world.The hiking team (from left to right): Sarah Craft, Andrew Moore, Linda Gosner, and Allison MickelCrafty just finished up the fourth year of her PhD at the Joukowsky Institute. She researches pilgrimage sites in central Turkey, so was mixing business and ‘pleasure’ in hiking up what seemed like 10000m in 30+ degree desert sun. She’s also been a great friend in my first year at Brown in showing me both the school and the city, and will be sorely missed this coming year as she lives in Istanbul with a fellowship at the Koç University Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations.I just met Andrew this year at Petra, where he’s working for the first time after finishing his MA at the University of Colorado Boulder. In the last week I’ve already discovered he has a wicked sense of humour and, after today, I also know the man is a beast when it comes to an intense hike. I’m sure there must be some goat blood in his family tree somewhere.Linda is another Brown student, so I’ve had the chance to get to know her pretty well in the last year. Aside from a shared love of dance (NB- she can actually dance, and I cannot), and a mutual hope for a Spain win against Italy on Sunday, we’ve also spent the last year in classes and brushing up on Latin to varying degrees of success. If I wanted to embarrass us both, I’d post the video of us re-enacting the opening scenes of the Lion King on the mountain today. I think this time discretion is the better part of valor.Allison is another person I’ve had the good fortune to meet this season at Petra, and has just finished up her first year of a PhD at Stanford. We’ve already had some great chats about communicating archaeology to the public. I don’t know how she made it up the mountain after a serious bout of sickness yesterday, but after some strategic shady stops, a lot of water, and even more stairs we emerged victorious to greet the others and have some lunch.Exhausted. A pilgrimage really is all about the journey.Perhaps unsurprisingly, a lot of the discussion of archaeology focusses on the archaeology itself- on the site, the materials, the landscape, the archive, the publication. But at least to me, the personal interactions on days like today leave a more lasting impression. Meeting and developing friendships with these people- the archaeologists, my peers- is the thing that is ultimately the most rewarding aspect of a career in archaeology. I’m looking forward to similar days of archaeological pilgrimage, both in the rest of my season with BUPAP and in the future.The A Day of Archaeologists by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"432","As you probably know by now if you have been following us on twitter (@FPANNrthCentral), we have been out at Munree Cemetery in Tallahassee today. We have been working with specially trained dogs called Human Remain Detection Canines, or HRD dogs. They have been helping us to find unmarked burials that are at minimum 100 years old! The Munree Cemetery is a historic African American cemetery with over 250 known burials, most of which do not have any type of marker present. Some of the graves are visible at the surface, but some areas we were unsure about. Of course, we wanted to avoid excavating in a cemetery, so we brought in the dogs! Two of the dogs and their handlers came all the way from Louisiana to help us out today! We also had a local dog handler and her HRD dog volunteer  to help us out. The dogs were able to identify several areas that possibly contain human burials. Tomorrow morning we are going to bring out the ground penetrating radar (GPR) to see if we can find any anomalies in those areas. The cemetery is five acres, and it would take us days to GPR the whole thing, and even longer to process all that data, so the dogs have helped us narrow down the areas to those that have the greatest probability of containing burials.Jada and Dixie, both specially trained HRD canines, traveled all the way from Louisiana with their handlers to help us today!The Human Remain Detection Dogs Help Archaeologists Find Unmarked Graves by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

However, two and a bit hours of training today and I can level it AND turn it on and off…. and some of those fancy bits in-between so I feel much more prepared for the copious amounts of surveying I will be involved in next week.Apart from that I have been arranging finds washing and marking sessions, animal bone and environmental archaeology workshops for our fantastic community archaeologists.My average working day is often completely unique in terms of what I get up too, that’s why I love working in archaeology so much! Some days I spend a lot of time answering and sending emails, largely to do with organising events for our community archaeology project. Some days are spent creating hand outs and guidance for the events and workshops that we run, and actually revising topics for myself so I can be more supportive in terms of answering questions for people. Then there are the days I spend actually supporting our volunteers in the workshops and activities that myself and our project team have organised. One of my main tasks in my current job role is trying to really engage the local community in archaeology, but that’s the easy part- they are all enthusiastic!Some days… I dig!Happy day of archaeology all!The Learning how to use a total station all over again! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"434","A day in my life as an archaeologist and finds specialist for English HeritageAs one of the small team of archaeologists within the Intervention and Analysis Division of English Heritage, based at Fort Cumberland, Portsmouth, and working 80% of full time due to the three young herberts who more than fill a million percent of the rest of time, my days are always full, and rarely the same. Technology, determination and flexible bosses enable me to cram a fair amount into a week.My day starts at around 5am with a reading of emails, then the next couple of hours are given over to lunchboxes, breakfasts, hens, cats, dogs, hamsters, after a smidge of yoga before the madness starts. Throughout this time I also tend to listen to the radio or the reading or the violin practice, while catching up on my Twitter feed (@Nicola_Hembrey), which is great for archaeological news (and a little bit of gossip!). Once the school runs are done I dash to the office, and I’m usually sitting at my desk with a fennel and ginger tea by 9.15am. I have a super view out over Hayling Island, and on a clear day I can hear, Table 2, your lunch is ready, from the pub over the stretch of water! I’ve been at the Fort for thirteen years and I love working within such a diverse, committed and interesting group of colleagues, although the annual ten months of horizontal rain can be a something of a trial.Fabulous office! Sharp eyes will note the obligatory boxes of finds and X-Rays. Sadly the shelves and stacks of books, and the lovely view, are out of shot…Yesterday I was – unusually – able to give myself over to an almost entire day of concentrating on one thing; the middle poster above is taken from the site I project manage, the Roman settlement opposite Silbury Hill, which we evaluated in the late summer of 2010, and for which the report is almost complete, hence a day of reading all the specialist contributions, and polishing up my own! I have written the artefacts report, and together with my colleague Vicky Crosby, who led the excavations, I’m working on the overview. I’ve been doing a great deal of thinking and reading in recent weeks about any ritual aspect to the site. We hope to submit the report to the local journal, the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine,  in good time before the end of August deadline. The project team have been brilliant in getting this to publication so quickly – in archaeological terms at least! – while under considerable pressure and uncertainty from our recent round of restructuring.Today, though, I don’t have the luxury of getting back to the Later Silbury report, as I have to finish off the list that I’ve been mentally carting around all week, to avoid next week spiralling away before I’m even out of this one. The illustrations need a final check. My mountain of library books needs renewing.  I’ve been asked to write a caption for a photograph for a colleague’s memorial event leaflet. I have to write the final section of my performance review. Timelog doesn’t complete itself. I desperately need to catch up on reading the Assessment Report for a project which I have been asked project manage following the redundancy of another colleague, a process which has been difficult for all of us, and the effects of which will be felt for a long while. I whizz down to our stash of outreach material, to find a few objects to donate to a project that wants to bury artefacts at sea for 25 years. I also reply to someone who is working on the update of the professional side of the EH website, after spending an hour writing comments on the pieces of text that he has sent me.Current reading, mostly concerned with the theorising of artefacts. Books strapped up in the old-fashioned way make me very happy…Last year I was able to write up the small assemblage of finds that came from our work as part of the Silbury Hill Conservation Project, and I was also lucky enough to revisit the finds from previous interventions in the area. The Monograph text is currently with our publications team. One of the most interesting objects was an unusual copper-alloy bracelet which came from the base of a Roman ditch, but was of Later Bronze Age or Earlier Iron Age date. This sent me off on a long thought process about the significance of heirloom artefacts – those old objects that are important to people because of their association with another person, or an idea, or a particular time in their life. It made me wonder whether getting to grips with this idea from a present perspective could illuminate our thinking about the importance of old objects in the past; something nigh-on impossible to get to grips with within the archaeological record. This led to the beginnings of a project that I’m hoping to get off the ground with a few colleagues; a public survey, with a large social media element, in which people can post details of their object, and from which we can analyse the data later. I made a phone call, to see if there had been any response yet to our proposal; nothing so far. Hopefully it will happen. Keep your eyes peeled for Objects Of My Affection.Finally while in the office I had a quick look over my website. I’m secretary and web editor for the Roman Finds Group, a forum for all those with an interest in the subject (do check us out online; we’re really very good). I added the details of our forthcoming meeting at the British Museum in April 2013, in which attendees can visit the Pompeii exhibition as part of the very reasonable conference fee (sorry, ad over now!). I’m lucky that EH gives me a small amount of time in which I can sit on this committee.I leave in time for the return school run, and spend the next couple of hours listening to stories of everyone’s day and making supper, while keeping my emails (and Twitter!) open from the iPad in the kitchen. It’s the best way to stay on top of things.I then spend a while re-reading comments that I wrote earlier in the week, on a finds report within a site publication which we have funded through our grants programme, National Heritage Protection Commissions. The report had been a long time coming, but turned out to be really well researched, well thought out and well written. I can easily see it becoming a ‘go-to’ text for finds reports when it’s published. If I have the space within my deadlines I like to write my comments and then leave them a day or so before sending, just to make sure that I haven’t missed anything.Working from home, commenting on a lengthy finds report. I don’t normally print out this much paper! Note the extremely hi-tech phone…Finally, I respond to an email from the Activity Lead of the Ploughzone Activity Team, which has recently been formed as part of the National Heritage Protection Plan. He needs all team members to comment on a proposal. Almost all of our communication is by email to keep costs down, as we come from EH offices all over the country. I add it to my mental list for next week, and mark the email unread, to remind myself.Later I’ll do some more reading, and thinking, if I don’t fall asleep first.So, there it is, a typical day in the life of this (lucky) archaeologist. I seem to have got all the way to the end of this post without including a picture of either an object, or myself, which is probably something of an oversight (particularly the former!). Here’s a happy picture of me (at front, red shoes) with the gorgeous site team at Later Silbury, instead. Nicola Hembrey, Archaeologist (Artefact Analysis), English Heritage  @Nicola_Hembrey29 vi 2012The Objects, Advice, and a Bit of Thinking… by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"435","And so we’ve reached our last section of the Museum of London’s Archaeological Archive. Thanks for playing the LAARC lottery and here are our last two objects for the Day of Archaeology.The Environmental section of our Archive is the smallest – representative of the small size of the flora and fauna that are processed by flotation through large-scale tanks with small-scale sieves. If you want to see what a raw sample looks like, check out Sarah Matthews (MOLA) ‘dirty’ blog.First up, our lucky lottery player chose shelf number 43 and our ecofact is a selection of seeds from site archive PRY91, an excavation that took place on the outer reaches of London in the borough of Kingston Upon Thames. This site produced a total of 61 sediment samples and the ecofacts date to the late Iron Age/Roman period. What we have here are cereal grains of wheat/barley. Our Archaeology Collections Manager, Glynn Davis, blogged about a similar ecofact from the City of London. These environmental ‘objects’ are extremely important for understanding cultivated foodstuffs as well as the nature of settlement itself.Wheat grains from the Iron Age/Roman period, and from our shelf 43And so, our last ecofact from a long day’s blogging. So what did shelf 36 have amongst its boxes…of course, it’s a coprolite!This sample, excavated from site BUF90 – Bull Wharf, Upper Thames Street, was accompanied by a note stating it was ‘hand collected’…archaeologists are known for their odd sense of humour.

"437","I was reminded by the blustery wet south-easterly tail wind on my cycle to work this morning that summer has yet to arrive to this part of the world. However, as an Archaeological Information Systems Manager for English Heritage based down in Fort Cumberland, Portsmouth, I’m mostly office based so the weather is only an issue when I venture out to get a cup of coffee.It has finally become apparent to me that communication is one of my main focuses. I am always asked what period or location I specialise in, the truth is I don’t take this approach to archaeology. My passion is for archaeology and archaeologists, how we communicate with each other and how we communicate with the public (who’s support we depend to continue doing what we do).So back to my day…After arriving in my office and making a cup of coffee I turned my attention to finalising a paper I’ve been writing called ‘Can you hack (the) communication?’ I gave a presentation on this at CAA in Southampton (http://caaconference.org/) (it’s a computers and archaeology conference) back in March. This paper looks at how we as archaeologists capture digital information in the field and particular my perspective on the experience of implementing a digital recording system for archaeological excavation called Intrasis to our teams. We’ve used the system now on our last few projects.This is a screenshot of a map of the excavations of the Roman Settlement across the road from Silbury Hill.As main ringleader of social media at the fort, I started receiving my colleagues’ posts for Day of Archaeology by mid-morning. That I know of two others are participating, one from our zooarchaeologists and another from @nicola_hembrey, our finds archaeologists.Through out the day, like most days I’m keeping an eye on my Twitter feed for good content and information @hscorley. I also am keeping an eye on the @EHArchaeology twitter account which I am primary curator. This account has been active for about 3 years now and I’m amazed how popular it has become.Looking at Twitter today, it is of course, abuzz with Day of Archaeology content. Particular praise is due to London Archaeological Archive & Research Centre (LAARC)  for the LAARC Lottery. If only I had thought if it myself. You pick a number for a shelf, they then go and find what’s on that shelf and blog about it. I like this for several reasons, not only is it interactive and raises awareness about their archive but it also means no one has to think to hard about what to write about, it’s all there just waiting to written about.As my day wraps up I’m going to prepare to face the elements again, the wind does not appear to have shifted and despite a bit of sunlight earlier it looks like it might rain.Hugh Corley@hscorleyThe Communicating Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"438","Today has been a typically varied day in the offices of Rubicon Heritage; we have just this week relocated our main Irish office from an industrial estate in Little Island to a much more central premises in Midleton, where our new neighbours fix pianos! Amidst the chaos of the move and some of the less glamorous but vital aspects of running a commercial business (such as checking and authorising payments, reviewing accounts and writing tenders) there has been one real highlight that I want to share with you. As Cork experiences horrendous weather conditions and widespread flooding, the Irish Summer has been forgotten in the Rubicon offices. The reason for this is an email I received yesterday, which revealed that we had discovered what appears to be an internationally significant archaeological find.What is particularly interesting about this find is that it is an advertisement for the wonders of archaeological conservation. During archaeological excavations for Cork County Council on a medieval castle site in Caherduggan, Co. Cork last year, we uncovered a well which contained a fantastic array of objects. Amongst the treasure trove of material that emerged from its muddy depths were a medieval leather shoe and an exquisite medieval bone die. But most interesting was a long strip of leather, with what appeared to be metal studs along its length (to read a post about when we discovered it see here). We initially thought this might be a belt, and without  further ado sent it off to the conservator, Susannah Kelly of University College Dublin, to see what remained.The leather belt on its discovery at Caherduggan Castle, Co. CorkAfter months of painstaking work, leather specialist John Nicholl took possession of the belt from Susannah this week, and yesterday sent me on some photographs of the now conserved object. When I opened the attachment to view the pictures I was greeted with a jaw-dropping sight- one of the most beautiful archaeological objects I have ever come across. The images revealed a phenomenally well preserved strip of leather with buckles at each end, and hinged heraldic shields mounted along its length. Excitement spread throughout the office like wildfire and I quickly got sidetracked, spending long minutes gazing at reference material. We put up a post here to share the information, and I arrived to work this morning to find some very interesting and helpful comment and responses. What we initially thought may be a scabbard belt is perhaps more likely a decorated medieval horse harness, undoubtedly the best preserved ever found in Ireland (and quite possibly Britain as well). All that normally survives of these decorated trappings are single harness pendants, but here we have a virtually complete example!The well preserved buckle still attached to the leather, and partial pendantsI began this morning with a look through my trusty copy of The Medieval Horse and It’s Equipment to learn more (meanwhile bombarding an equally excited specialist John with questions!), and it appears we really may have something special with this find. Indications are that in the 13th century the use of these pendants on horse equipment became more numerous, but were in decline by the end of the 14th century- this may suggest a potential 14th century date, which would tie in with our other objects from the well. Next I fired off an email to the Office of the Chief Herald in Dublin to see if they could tell me anything about the heraldic symbol on the pendants, which appears to be a lion. They informed me that a lion rampant is associated with the O’Keeffes, a Cork family, although there is no evidence as yet that the object belonged to them. They also pointed out that on the Caherduggan pendants the lion is facing the opposite way to what would normally be expected in heraldry (described as lion counter-rampant or lion rampant to the sinister), making it a rarity. Contact with the National Museum of Ireland revealed that they have a collection of individual pendants that have been retrieved from illegal metal detectorists, so we now have the always enjoyable prospect of a trip to the Museum to have a look for some parallels. I also took a few minutes to look through the Portable Antiquities Scheme database to discover if there were any parallels in the UK (to have a look at the results I got see here).A detail of a portion of the belt with the mounts complete and intact, showing the lion motifWe have barely scratched the surface of uncovering the story of this beautiful and potentially unique find, and there is undoubtedly much more to add before we are finished. However, for today we are still trying to get to grips with the excitement of the discovery, and are busy getting experts together so we can explore all the possibilities- all in all a very good day to be in the Rubicon office! To follow updates on this object and other work we carry out you can check out our blog at www.rubiconblog.com!The other buckle with complete hinged pendants visible The Rubicon’s Best Ever Find?

"439","Today seems a very opportune moment to blog about my life as an archaeologist, as it’s the final day of the academic year at York, and everyone is revelling over the coming of summer.  I have something more to celebrate as well, as I’ve finally had time to sign the contract that turns my currently fixed-term position at York into an ‘open’ (permanent) lectureship.  Yay!I have looked back at my contribution to the 2011 Day of Archaeology, and this has led me to reflect on the incredible changes that have presented themselves in my life since then.  Exactly a year and one day ago I graduated with my PhD in Archaeology from Southampton, and then left for fieldwork at Çatalhöyük.  I started my post at York in January, and at the same time as launching into the design and teaching of a series of new classes and modules, I closed off some research projects (e.g., our Wellcome Collection Brains exhibition – see photo below!) whilst embarking on others (e.g., the Urban Cultural Heritage and Creative Practice collaborative).Me, June 2012, basking in the glow of my little acknowledgement at the Wellcome Collection exhibition, Brains: The Mind as MatterAmidst all this activity, though, there has been one clear constant, and that is the relentless pace of scholarly life.  At any given time an academic is torn between a seemingly infinite number of obligations, and it would be difficult to accurately characterise the amount of multi-tasking—and the ever-increasing number of emails and responsibilities—that come with the job.  It’s such diversity and challenge that makes this lifestyle energising and inspiring for me—but it is also indescribably demanding, and there is a consistent concern in the back of my mind that I may have missed or skipped over something critical to my work in all the frenzy.  Today alone I had 3 student meetings and a departmental meeting to attend; I am negotiating the start-up of two new projects, and am analysing data from an ongoing project at King’s College London; I am preparing documentation for our fourth season at Çatalhöyük this summer; I am arranging a qualitative methods workshop to run in a couple of weeks, as well as helping to facilitate some filming at the Archaeology Department here in York around the same time; I have a book chapter that demands completion, along with an unspeakable number of emails in my inbox that require attention.  Even as I write this list, I can think of at least a half-dozen other tasks that need consideration.But whilst the scale of the workload could be paralysing—or, at a minimum, disillusioning—I have moments every day where I think how fortunate I am to be doing what I’m doing.  Most often, these moments present themselves in my interactions with students and in teaching, something which I never would have expected given that so many people seem to disparage the experience of being a teacher.  For me, however, the enthusiasm of the students at York, the chance to watch them develop and experiment with their ideas, and the opportunity to see them present their work and gain confidence in themselves and in their intellectual capacities, make my job extraordinary.  The relentless nature of academia could easily consume you, I think, but it’s in those conceptual and material engagements with others that the frenzy slips away and you’re left with a sense of real inspiration.  Indeed, for me, it’s not just inspiration, but hopefulness and excitement about what’s to come tomorrow.The End of the Academic Year at York by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"440","In an average week, members of the Flinders Archaeological Society (ArchSoc) committee spend hours organising events and opportunities for the professional development and social interaction of archaeology students from Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Today is different, however, because we are taking time out for the exam period and end of semester assessments, and although we are not doing an incredible amount today, ArchSoc wanted to support this fantastic project nonetheless.Semester one, 2012 has been a particularly busy semester for ArchSoc as we have organised an unprecedented number of events, and we have witnessed unprecedented high membership rates. For the most part, we assist the Department of Archaeology in hosting visiting archaeologists by making their time at Flinders an enjoyable experience. In many ways we are the life and energy of Flinders archaeology.This semester began with a field trip. We sent a group of eight students to the Port Arthur Heritage Site in Tasmania to assist the local archaeologists in cleaning and cataloging artefacts from a recent excavation. The students that attended this trip had no previous archaeological experience and ArchSoc is proud to have given them this opportunity.Site survey at Port ArthurNext we ran a pub crawl. This event saw around one hundred archaeology students hitting the town in our bright blue t-shirts. How do you like the design? ArchSoc conducted a site survey and a ‘Meet the Archaeologists! ‘ night to coincide with National Archaeology Week and ‘About Time: South Australia’s History Festival’. These events saw many members of the public actively engaging with archaeologists and students (out of over 500 events, ours were consistently listed as the first and second most popular throughout the festival!).Our final event for semester one was a quiz night among the cells and gallows at the heritage listed Adelaide Gaol. The table of lecturers lost to a student table by only 0.5 points!!Without a doubt, this semester has been fantastic and beneficial to Flinders archaeology students, not only in their professional development, but in social interactions as well (arguably the greatest aspect of this semester has been our new item of merchandise: Flinders ArchSocks!).Here’s to another great semester!

"442","This is my last summer of ‘freedom’ before I start writing up my PhD thesis, and so I thought I would spend some time avoiding my database and volunteering for the WEA, who are now well into the first year of their Inclusive Archaeology Education Project. The project is being rolled out across Yorkshire and the Humber, and aims to provide opportunities for people under-represented in archaeology to learn about and participate in archaeology.The three year project will enable 300 people, including adults with learning disabilities, mental health service users, adults with physical disabilities and members of black, asian and minority ethnic communities to get involved in archaeology. The courses include a classroom component and then a number of field trips to archaeological sites across the region.This week I was involved in a ‘bones’ session with the Sheffield group. A couple of us from the Osteoarchaeology group at the University of Sheffield ran a session looking at both human and animal bones. This involved an ‘exploding sheep’ activity, where each of the learners were given some bones from a sheep and had to work out what part of the body they were from, and re-fit them. We also did a similar activity for our human skeleton. We also talked about bones from different animals and the learners had to guess which animals some bones belonged to. It was a great afternoon, the learners were very enthusiastic about the activities, and we had loads of fun!I’m very much looking forward to volunteering on some of the upcoming field trips with the group over the next month. It has been a pleasure working with them!To find out more about the Inclusive Archaeology Education Project then visit their blog here: http://digability.wordpress.comTo find out about Zooarchaeology and Human Osteology at the University of Sheffield go to: http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/archaeology   The Osteoarchaeology with the WEA in Sheffield by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"443","“Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library. Research. Reading.”Which eminent scholar confidently states that statistic? Certainly someone from the last half-century, right? Perhaps an archaeologist who is concerned with the inherently destructive nature of our field.Nope. Indiana Jones.He utters these words in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It rings ironic not only just for the general practices of this fictional character, but also because he has just told his students that archaeology is not “about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world,” yet he is about to hand the speciously-acquired Cross of Coronado to Marcus Brody.As modern archaeologists we know Indiana Jones’ methods are deplorable and those of us who teach archaeology likely use him as an example of “worst practices.” Yet the paradoxical warning to his students that archaeology is largely an indoor activity is perhaps something we can learn from today.It has been exactly ten years since I have done actual “dirt archaeology.” Leading up to the writing of my doctoral dissertation I worked with the Università di Roma “La Sapienza” in Pompeii, at the Triangular Forum and in the Casa della Pescatrice. In those ten years, I have finished the dissertation, presented a score or so of conference papers and public lectures, and published a number of articles on my research. I’ve taught courses at the university level on field methods, yet most of my archaeological teaching is on theory, history, methods, and ethics.The author “actually doing archaeology,” Pompeii, 2000.My own research–on the architecture and decoration of houses and villas in Roman Italy–has by and large been carried out in archives, libraries, and museums. For my study of the Casa di Octavius Quartio at Pompeii, I of course spent a lot of time on that site, but it was taking photographs and measurements. It would have been easy for someone to mistake me for a tourist (not that there is anything wrong with that). My fieldwork this summer also involves basically visiting sites and museums, snapping more pictures, and taking more notes. But the first half of the summer has been spent in the library. Research. Reading. And, most importantly, writing.It is perhaps due in part to a small measure of insecurity that I feel like I have to justify myself as “a real archaeologist” despite the fact I haven’t put a trowel in the earth in a decade. But as I see more and more data being produced by new excavations and more and more sites going uninterpreted, I can’t personally advocate for digging when there is so much more library work to be done.There are, sadly, no professional restrictions on excavating without publishing, and so the fun work of digging gets done while the less-exciting work of analysis and writing gets postponed. This is always a point I raise with my students as we discuss archaeological ethics. I ask them if permits to excavate should be tied to a responsibility to publish results. The answer is always an overwhelming “yes.” As I say, excavating without publishing is like winking in the dark: you know what you’re doing, but nobody else does.At Pompeii, there is a crisis of conservation. Every few months or so a wall collapses (never mind the fact that most of these walls are post-World War II restorations). With all due respect to my colleagues who are excavating there this summer, I can’t see the point of digging when we are losing already-excavated material (or when material sits in storage sheds, unexamined, for years). It is much easier to secure funding for excavation than for conservation, generally speaking. Lay people get it when you say you are going on an archaeological dig. But just preserving what is already excavated seems less sexy, somehow, even if fundamentally most people who love learning about the past know that we must protect its material remains. And as we all learn on our first day of Archaeology 101, the wise words of Sir Mortimer Wheeler, “archaeology is destruction.”And so I will spend my Day of Archaeology by and large in the library. As a means to understand how Romans constructed individual and collective identity through their domestic collections of art and other objects, I am reading about “cabinets of curiosity” from the early modern period as well as sociological methods on houses and personal collections. And I will write down what I think, on the way to getting these ideas published.Would Indiana Jones think I am a “real archaeologist”? Do you? It feels like archaeology to me.Francesca Tronchin teaches at Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, USA. She has a Twitter and a Tumblr.

"446","Day of Archaeology: Blog 5 – TextilesMoving onto and into our Leather & Textile store, we have two classic objects chosen by you, completely at random.Our first randomly selected object, from shelf number 876, is a Roman leather shoe, excavated from site BUC87 – once the heart of Londinium. The LAARC holds over 5000 Roman and medieval shoes (we are the largest Archeological Archive in the world after all) and this artefact is a fine example of its type. The leather sole of the shoe has been preserved through waterlogged conditions but once exposed would quickly dry and shrink. Luckily the Museum ofLondon’s conservation department owns a magic machine called a freeze-dryer which, through the process of sublimation, leaves these leather objects in a very stable condition.Roman leather shoe from BUC87 – and shelf 876 A common comment on archaeological Roman shoes is that they always seem very small. The leather may have shrunk somewhat after two millennia in the ground and the freeze-drying process may add minimally to this, but on the whole our Roman Londoners seem to have small feet…Perhaps a comparative study should be conducted with the many Roman skeletal remains held at the Museum’s Centre for Human Bioarchaeology!Our second object is a piece of post-medieval textile from site EAG87  (and shelf 809), excavated by the Department of Urban Archaeology (DUA) back in the late 1980s. Archaeological textiles suffer from damage to both their texture and colour; however, our Curator of Fashion & Decorative Arts gets particularly excited about brown bits of wool!Post-medieval cloth from EAG87 – and shelf 809Again our textile much like other organics and inorganic, such as metal, has survived through waterlogged but anaerobic conditions. This fragmentary piece was probably part of the C18th backfill of a well excavated on this site.Our last major store section holds our Environmental finds. These are typically extremely small objects that take up little space (hence the small shelf range) and include objects such as seeds, pollen and small animal bones etc. Tweet using #dayofarch or #LAARC, or message us a number below, between 1 and 44 to discover, completely at random, what that shelf holds…The Day of Archaeology – LAARC Lottery Part 5 (Textile Finds) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"449","Even though the largest part of the day is occupied with work, there is always a moment I can dedicate to archaeology, amateur archaeology or armchair archaeology you may well call it. I don’t dig archaeological sites but I dig into any form of information, be it publications or the internet. I even get out of my armchair to dedicate my entire vacation to visiting archaeological sites, museums and exhibitions and taking pictures of stuff a normal person would walk by.  All because I want to tell the story of Sardinia and Sicily in prehistoric times.Giant statue of Monte Prama. Over 5000 fragments and pieces were assembled in 28 statues to be displayed to the public for the first time in 2011. I made the trip in december to visit this exhibition.I take my pictures of stones and sherds, publish them on my site and tell my visitors what they are looking at. I tell them why these stones or sherds are interesting and what happened to them in the past. I hope to attract their attention beyond their normal level of knowledge, to get them to look at details and not to walk past them, to recognize what they are looking at, and even perhaps enjoy what they are visiting, beyond the usual ten to thirty minutes it takes to bore them to death (seen one seen them all, it’s just a heap of stones what’s the use).Decorated pottery Bonu Ighinu culture on display at the archaeological museum G.A. Sanna at Sassari, Sardinia. Treasures of the past.So I sit in my armchair, well really it is an old kitchen chair, in front of my screen working away hundreds of images, reading endless stuff and combining it into texts hoping to capture the imagination of the traveller, the schoolkid, even the scholar, the same way these stones and sherds are capturing my own imagination. I sit there in the morning before going to work, sometimes in the evening to write some text, getting my satisfaction from a one-liner, a single appreciating remark left as a comment, bridging in my way the gap between the archaeologist who enthusiastically uncovered his artifact and the larger public interested in a remote past. Timbert29th of june 2012 at the #dayofarchThe Every Day Bridging a Gap in My Mind by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"450","I love being in the field, but this year I’m not excavating. My work is museum related for now, an important part of what we do. So, here’s my Day of Archaeology so far:Got up around 6:30am and checked my email through my Blackberry. Found that our subcontract to the British Museum has gone through (much of what I do these days is done jointly with London and they are five hours ahead of me, so they have already begun work when I get up).Got to the museum around 8:00am. I live nearby, which I like because I can walk to work. My computer is my secretary, so I checked on my ‘to do’ file. Yes, if I were more up-to-date I’d just use Google Calendar or some such, but I like having individual files for each day on my hard drive. I looked through the previous day making sure the most pressing things got done, deleting those items and assigning most pressing for today. I had a committee meeting for the Ur Project yesterday; I have to write up the minutes today for distribution to others on the project, that gets the most pressing mark for the morning. Brad Hafford in his cluttered office, 524 Museum Our project is taking legacy data, excavation material from 1922-1934, and modernizing, that is, recording it all digitally and uniting it in one place – the interweb. The excavation was a very important one, that of the ancient city of Ur in southern Iraq and was conducted jointly by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum. Under laws of the day, artifacts collected were divided between the nascent state of Iraq with its newly founded National Museum and the two excavating institutions. Thus, half the artifacts are in Baghdad, the other half are split between Philadephia and London. But there is much more to an excavation than artifacts. There are also field notes, photographs, catalogues, letters, telegrams, receipts, drawings, watercolors, and so much more. We are digitizing and uniting all of this material. We want to create a site where anything and everything concerning Ur and its excavation can be accessed, researched, and gazed upon in wonder; all in open-source, freely accesible and linked data form.Creating it takes time, patience, and money. It takes access to the artifacts and archives which are not solely spread among the three museums mentioned, but objects also secondarily sent to many smaller museums around the world, paricularly the Commonwealth at the time. There are Ur artifacts from our excavations as far afield as Australia and New Zealand. And many more in the UK: Almost 1000 artifacts are in the Birmingham Museum and Art Galleries. Not only that, but reconstructing the original numbering system for artifacts and photographs, and connecting that to the modern museum numbering systems, linking objects back to their original field records is not as easy as one might think. Our work is quite complicated. But also most worthwhile.Museum cafe opens around 9am. Armed with coffee, and organized on my computer daily to-do list, I can face the rest of my day in confidence.10:00am Eastern: Skype conference with British Museum colleagues. We’ve been trying now for some weeks to establish dates and room reservations for a project meeting near the end of the calendar year. Since this one needs to include funding agency, high-level museum administrators, principle investigators, other museum representatives, etc. it’s been difficult to mesh schedules. It’s also difficult to get space in the British Museum since it is in high demand.Next we discussed the state of the merger of datasets between our two museums concerning Ur. It’s going slowly because we created our digital data from two sets of records divided by decades and the Atlantic. These records have to be meshed so that a unique identifier refers to each and every object. Then we have to get it all on a server so that both museums can access, update, and correct it. As I have probably already noted, re-unification is not easy. But we have great people on both sides of the pond working on it. Birmingham is on board and we’re starting the process of contacting the other institutions that have subsets of the Ur material. And of course we’re still trying to get the Iraq National Museum on board, but politics has gotten in the way for now.More emails and arrangements have placed me at about the half-way point of my Day of Archaeology.

"451","The Preservation of Orange County, California’s PrehistoryThe John D. Cooper Archaeological and Paleontological Center is a partnership between Orange County through Orange County Parks and California State University Fullerton.  The Cooper Center is committed to the preservation, curation, management, and use in research, education, outreach, and exhibits of the artifacts and fossils that have been collected within Orange County over the last 40 years. The artifacts and fossils were obtained from sites in Orange County that have undergone cultural resources management (CRM) studies. Such studies are conducted as part of the permitting process for the construction of houses, office buildings, roads, freeways, and other urban developments. The collections at the Cooper Center include artifacts and fossils recovered since the 1970s. Together, the Cooper Center’s archaeological and paleontological collections provide a fantastic chronicle of the history of life in today’s Orange County.The Cooper Center’s archaeological holdings are diverse and range in age from at least 10,000 years ago up until 50 years ago. The Cooper Center’s collection includes materials from all areas and environmental zones throughout the County including the coast, major and minor rivers, and foothill-zones. Sites from these various areas include, but are not limited to, villages, fishing, milling activities associated with acorn and hard seed processing, and stone tool manufacture. Some of the artifact types recovered from these sites include cogstones, metates and manos, mortars and pestles, shell beads, hammerstones, projectile points, scrapers, incised stone and pottery sherds to name a few. Archaeologists have also recovered historic artifacts from the last century, including glass bottles, barbed wire, and plastic toys. These sites and artifacts are not only the most extensive collection of Orange County history and prehistory, but they provide archaeologists with an extensive view of what life was like in Orange County.The rocks of Orange County contain the fossilized remains of plants and animals from every major time period since the Jurassic – 180 million years of history. The study of these fossils provides an important link to the geological past and can be helpful in answering scientific questions important to Orange County and elsewhere. The Cooper Center’s paleontological material has worldwide significance as it includes an unparalleled collection of marine mammals from the Miocene through the Pleistocene. The marine life collection includes invertebrates, whales, sharks, porpoises, walrus, and sea lions – not found anywhere else, including evolutionary links and new species. The collection also includes some of the few scraps of dinosaurs known from California, and terrestrial mammals and reptiles from the Eocene, late Oligocene, Miocene, and Pleistocene including brontotheres, crocodiles, snakes, sabre-toothed deer, an early bear, primates, camels, horses and sabre-toothed cats. Lifetimes of research and discoveries could stem from this collection.The Cooper Center opened in July of 2011 and just recently became fully staffed.  The staff includes Director, Jere H. Lipps, Ph.D., a renowned scientist with extensive academic, scientific and museum management experience and a passion for the history of life. Dr. Lipps joined the Center in January of 2012. Edward Knell, Ph.D., RPA, is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at California State University Fullerton, and serves as the Faculty Curator for Archaeology and Jim Parham, Ph.D. was recently appointed as the Faculty Curator for Paleontology and will join the staff in the Fall. The Faculty Curators provide direction and guidance for the Archaeology and Paleontology collections at the Cooper Center. Jeannine Pedersen, M.A. is the Associate Curator for Archaeology and has and over fifteen years of experience working with cultural collections. Meredith Rivin, M.S. is the Associate Curator for Paleontology and has extensive experience in Cultural Resource Management in both paleontology and archaeology.  The Associate Curators are charged with the tasks of managing the Center’s Archaeology and Paleontology Laboratories, caring for and curating the artifacts and fossils, promoting and conducting research and assisting with education, exhibit and outreach projects. Under the direction of California State University Fullerton, the staff of the Cooper Center is the steward for Orange County’s archaeological and paleontological collections.At this point, only a small fraction of the Cooper Center collection has been inventoried – about 6000 specimens and 5,000 artifacts out of an estimated 2,000,000+ from over 900 paleontological localities and over 400 archaeological sites. Ongoing work seeks to curate the artifacts and fossils to meet and/or exceed federal standards of preservation and to provide state-of-the-art facilities where students, professionals, qualified researchers, and interested parties can study the collections.  The Cooper Center also seeks to educate students of all ages and the public within Orange County (and beyond) about the history of where they live.For more information please visit our website at http://coopercenter.fullerton.edu/; Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/John-D-Cooper-Center-Archaeology-Lab/170839769650965; follow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/#!/CooperCenter_OC; or check out the Cooper Channel on YouTube http://www.youtube.com/user/CooperCenterOC?feature=watch.The The John D.

"452","Rescue – The British Archaeological Trust have been working for British archaeology for the last 40 years. We continue to campaign, and represent archaeology at a wide level, as well as giving support to those protecting heritage up and down the country. The Day of Archaeology 2012 is a perfect opportunity to tell you more about what we do, a lot of it behind the scenes, as an independent organisation committed to the protection, conservation, recording and interpretation of archaeology.RESCUE was founded in 1971 at a time when archaeology in Britain was facing a catastrophic situation.  None of the larger, well-funded representational bodies which we now take for granted (ALGAO, SCAUM, IFA, ARIA), were in existence and the Council for British Archaeology was little more than a federation of regional groups which met to discuss common interests.  Only in Winchester, Oxford and Southampton was there any ongoing archaeological presence.  Elsewhere rescue excavation was undertaken by a diverse mixture of academics, inspectors employed by the Ministry of Works, museum curators and local amateur/voluntary societies.  Although many of these individuals and groups did good work, often under extremely difficult circumstances, others were overwhelmed by the rapid pace of destruction.  Even today many local and regional museums have substantial bodies of unpublished material dating from this time.The later 1960s and early 70s saw the establishment of Britain’s motorway network, the redevelopment of town centres and the creation of New Towns throughout the Midlands and south-east.  These initiatives involved enormous threats to sites and monuments, none of which were protected or even recognised by existing legislation which dated back to the late 19th century. In spite of the heroic efforts of individual archaeologists and local societies, it was clear that there were no institutions capable of mounting the type of sustained response to these threats that was required.  In addition the sums of money available from the Ministry of Works were wholly inadequate to the tasks of excavation and recording.  There was little recognition of the costs of post excavation work or publication.Rescue was founded in order to draw attention to this situation and to organise a practical response to it.  Early members included many whose names have subsequently become well known both inside archaeology and outside; Philip Barker, Martin Biddle, Barri Jones, Robert Kiln, Philip Rahtz, Charles Thomas and many others were active in establishing the new organisation and making it into an active campaigning body capable of bringing pressure to bear on local authorities, developers and the government and making the crisis a matter of national concern.  Early supporters in Parliament were drawn from across the political parties with Tam Dalyell prominent amongst those backing Rescue’s activities.In 1972 a junior branch, Young Rescue, was founded by Kate Pretty and local groups sprang up throughout the country.  At least one member, a certain Dr. Simon Thurley, still has his membership card and fond memories of the work of Young Rescue.40 years later the threats haven’t gone away, they just take different forms. Rescue has been at the forefront of campaigning for improvements to legislation – including the recent National Planning Policy Framework, as well as highlighting threats to both terrestrial and maritime heritage, reaching many members through our publication Rescue News.Most recently, we have been documenting the unprecedented level of cuts to museum and archaeology services up and down the country, and have been equipping local communities to Fight Back. We all strongly believe this is vital work, protecting heritage, 40 years on. The Rescue – Still Campaigning for Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"453","   And in the end …Visitors to the hoard site in the rainThe discovery, reporting, excavation, investigation and analysis of this hoard have taken over a year. In that time a detailed picture has evolved which has shed new light on events that happened more than 300 years ago. Coin hoards from the Civil War are relatively common with several known for each county in Britain; so many hoards show the upheaval and underlying worry of the general population. This urgency and unrest can be seen in Bitterley hoard – where the only direct archaeological evidence for the placing of the hoard in the ground– is the hoard itself. The excavation showed that the burying of the hoard was relatively quick – in a prepared container. The local events that caused the hoard to be buried are unknown but the fact that they were never retrieved suggests that something happened to the owner and unfortunately their loss has been our gain.I would like to thank all the people involved in this treasure case – as well as those who have helped tell the story so far. I would like to say a special thankyou to the farmer – for giving us access to his land and also (most importantly) to the finder – Howard Murphy – who did the right thing in leaving the coins in the ground and calling in the PAS. He has enabled us to piece together a remarkable story. I hope this will inspire other detectorists to do the same when they make their next big find!Peter Reavill29th June 2012The The Bitterley Hoard: Part Seven – Concluding thoughts by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Photo: Asa M LarssonRescue excavations – the curse and boon of our profession. We may bleed for the heritage sites that are lost forever, but without the expansion of modern society we would get very little chance to peek into prehistory on a grand scale. This summer there are a lot of archaeologists crawling around Gamla (Old) Uppsala in Sweden, the idyllic suburb north of present day Uppsala, where the impressive great burial mounds of some undisclosed Iron Age VIPs still stand.Urbanisation came late to this part of Northern Europe, but Uppsala was probably one of the first places in Sweden where this happened, sometime in the Early Middle Ages (or Late Iron Age as the period is still called here in Scandinavia). Exactly when – and how – is a matter of fierce debate, so you can imagine the gleeful joy with which archaeologists here greeted the fact that the railroad drawn straight through Gamla Uppsala needed to be expanded. It’s a massive project involving thousands of square meters of Iron Age and Medieval settlement sites as well as an Iron Age cemetery. It is also one of the most protected heritage areas in Sweden, so the project is a collaborative effort involving our own firm SAU, the Uppland County Museum, as well as the archaeological unit of the National Heritage Board. The more the merrier!Sofia Prata, osteologist at SAU, is excavating a burial urn with a cremation from the Viking Age cemetery at Old Uppsala. Photo: Asa M LarssonNot that I get to stick my fingers into the rich, dark culture layers with amulet rings and bear claw clasps, stuck behind a desk as I am doing administrative work as usual. But I manage to sneek out now and then and visit my colleagues in the field. So far the SAU team have found parts of a smithy and several pit houses, as well as long houses from the Vendel and Viking periods (c. 550-750 CE and 750-1050 CE respectively). The cremation cemetery that was identified in a field during last year’s test excavations has turned out to be much larger and more well preserved that we had expected – which is fun but, as we all know, also a bit of a headache for the County Museum that oversees the excavation. The osteologists from SAU will have their hands full, analysing all the cremated human and animal bones.Celebrating with ice coffee and cherries – ’cause we earned it!Still, contrary to popular opinion not all archaeologists are out in the field during the summer. Some  have been chained to their desk to finish up a report on sites in that we excavated a few years ago. These Bronze and Early Iron Age sites and burials in Northeastern Uppland were established during a perod where the region changed from archipleago, to coast, to inland due to the shore displacement going on since the end of the Ice Age. Today we were frantically double and triple checking the text and illustrations before handing in the manuscript to the Uppsala County Board, who will decide if it can be published.Afterwards we celebrated. On Monday we continue with other projects at hand, or in a few cases, actually take a vacation…If you find yourselves in the vicinity of Uppsala this summer and autumn, be sure to visit us – we have guided tours in English as well.The Old Uppsala and Beyond by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"456","I believe the normal archaeologist work day is to enter the office (or the field) in the am with a work plan then watch it change almost immediately.This is why I like this job, it’s ever-changing.  I became smitten with the idea of archaeology and palaeontology at an early age (grade 2 I believe) yet I never would have considered what the ‘job’ would be. Back then, it was dreams of digging and discovery. Now it’s about protection, understanding and education much of the time.Talking to local students and their teachers about archaeology at Louisbourg, at the rescue excavation site of an 18th century fishing property on the North Shore of Louisbourg harbour at the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site of Canada in 2010I work in CRM (cultural resource management) at the Fortress of Louisbourg, a national historic site in Canada. Louisbourg is a large 18th century French fortress & fishing community site located on the eastern tip of Cape Breton Island in the province of Nova Scotia. This rough & foggy place was the French stronghold in the region and a busy transhipment centre and port for the cod fishery. Two rather dramatic sieges eventually led to the destruction of the fortress and abandonment of the community in the late 18th century. Given it’s rather isolated location, not much happened to the fortress & surrounds after its fall, so we now have a massive archaeological site with resources scattered over 22 square kilometers of terrain, as well as sunken warships in the harbour.25% or 14 acres of the 60-acre Fortress of Louisbourg has been reconstructed and is open to visitors in the summer months with full animation, cannons firing, livestock and a variety of activities.  The reconstruction was carried out over a 20 year period (1960s-80s) and required a huge archaeological effort to guide the process (along with all the historians, restoration architects, artisans, etc). The concept of historical archaeology was pretty new in the 1960s, and much was learned about the discipline on the grounds of Louisbourg. This had a good/bad impact on the site but to be fair, the greatest learning often stems from mistakes. I suppose this is one of Louisbourg’s contributions to the development of the discipline in this country.Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site of Canada. Showing the 14-acre reconstructed part of the 60-acre fortress. The site is open to visitors in the summerToday, archaeology has a different role at Louisbourg.  On one hand, there is still much to learn about the site since only a fraction of it has been studied. We plug away at improving our understanding of the 18th century community through focused archaeological and historical research and this information is carried forward via public presentations, animation, publications and the like. On the other hand, much of my time, as the site archaeologist, is spent addressing site protection. Louisbourg was first recognized as a valued historic site by the Colonial Wars Society in 1898 and became designated as a site of national historic significance in 1928. Since then, the coastally-positioned fortress & community has seen the effects of weathering, time and climate change. Spruce forests regenerate over the abandoned battlefields, kelp shrouds the shipwrecks, waves pound down on the fortress walls and the seas rise and rise and rise. It’s a big job keeping track of these impacts and mitigating their effects through routine monitoring and various actions such as vegetation management programs, rescue archaeology, etc.Eroding glacis (fortress outerwork) at the Fortress of Louisbourg, following a series of powerful storms in December 2010However, while doing our best to work with Mother Nature to protect Louisbourg for future generations, as others have done before us, we enjoy the opportunity to learn more about the site through a public archaeology program. This program, co-run by Parks Canada and the Fortress Louisbourg Association, allows us to continue excavation within the footprint of the reconstructed site while giving archaeology enthusiasts an opportunity to work on a dig at a great site and learn about historical archaeology.Public archaeology excavation in the De la Vallilère yard at the Fortress of LouisbourgScreening artifacts from the soil and talking to visitors during the public archaeology programThe public archaeology program is offered in August every year (started in 2005) for two 5-day sessions. We’ve been working in the yard of the De la Vallière property for several years now to get a closer look at this property and better handle on how it was used. During the reconstruction project, research focused on the buildings since they need to be designed and rebuilt and little attention was paid to the outdoor areas – the yards, roadways, drainage systems, gardens, etc. We are taking a closer look at these areas now because they were an important part of the community – can you imagine interpretation of your own home town without looking at your streets, yards and below-ground infrastructure?So, today, I’m preparing for the 2012 public archaeology program and have just posted the 2009 field season review on the program website. This way, past participants can see how things are progressing, as well as the results of their time in the field. At the same time, I’m creating another series of web postings for the Parks Canada Fortress of Louisbourg website. These will provide an overview of current archaeological research at the fortress and in the collection, including some recent research conducted by university students for their thesis work. I think it’s important to inform the public about our research, new findings, opportunities, challenges and efforts to protect the valued resources of the site.Later, since it’s such a fine, sunny Friday, I think I’ll hop in the truck and go check on the coastline around the North Shore of the harbour to see how things are looking today. It’s been a mild winter with few hurricane hits so things look pretty stable along the shores these days - this will not be the case for long. I’ve been surveying the 13 km long shoreline at Louisbourg for over a decade and have seen the remarkable power of hurricanes and nor’easters. So, I’ve developed a healthy respect for the sea; it always wins. Knowing this helps us make the right protection decisions for the site. Protection doesn’t mean fighting the forces of nature, it means working with them.Yikes. It’s lunchtime now and there’s still much to do. I hope everyone is having an equally good indoor-outdoor, fun & productive Day of Archaeology.The Gearing Up For Public Archaeology at the Fortress of Louisbourg, Among Other Things by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"457","This is Jebel Harun:It’s the supposed site where Aaron (Harun in Arabic) died during the Israelite’s Exodus from Egypt.  It’s the location of his tomb, and a mosque was built on the site in the 14th century.  You can see the gleaming white dome of the mosque from many points in the area around Petra, where I’m working this season with the Brown University Petra Archaeological Project (BUPAP).Two years ago, I was working on a different project in the region, the Bir Madhkur Project, with Dr. Andrew M. Smith II (George Washington University).  Bir Madhkur is about 10 km northeast of Petra, and we talked many times about hiking to Jebel Harun.  But I never did.So now, two years later, our dig house is walking distance from Petra’s city center—from which Jebel Harun is about a 6 hour round trip hike.  It is the perfect opportunity to accomplish things unaccomplished, to navigate more of this rocky landscape that always yields new discoveries and experiences: new tombs and shrines and beytels carved into the sandstone, more welcoming Bedouins urging you to take tea with them.  Today was our day off at BUPAP, and we planned all week to hike to Jebel Harun.But then yesterday, I was hit with just another reality of the archaeological lifestyle: the tendency to get suddenly and violently ill.  It was graphic.  My body rejected even the smallest offerings of pita and water with astonishing force while I feverishly dreamt about mutant Bedouin dogs and riding a tractor to site.And then, as quickly as I felt so sick, I felt much better.  I really, really wanted to hike to Jebel Harun.I admit it. I was holding back before. This is Jebel Harun:The hike was extremely difficult; not, as the Lonely Planet suggests, for the reasonably fit at all—more for those who have goat-blood coursing through their veins.  There were several times I was scoping the terrain for a safe helicopter landing. But ultimately, having lunch on top of Aaron’s tomb, being able to see Petra’s monastery from a perspective so few people get to see, looking around at that vast desert landscape and recognizing the tremendous capability of the various groups throughout history who have made it home—all of these things made every single dehydrated step entirely worthwhile.And for me, this experience is entirely, fundamentally, archaeological.  So much of what we do involves preliminary assessment of resources, identifying sites, performing minimally invasive research like GPR and pedestrian survey—simply finding out what’s there.  Like my first archaeological project in Jordan, archaeologists spend a lot of time gathering the data necessary to make the case that intensive excavation—or conservation—should proceed.  We work extremely hard—and rightfully so—to justify our work since, as we so often repeat like a mantra, it integrally involves the destruction of cultural and historical resources.  We have the capability to determine, with a fair amount of certainty, whether we should excavate, whether this is the opportune moment to move forward, whether the benefits of digging in outweigh the costs.  And in the case of Jebel Harun—despite all the factors indicating this was not the opportune moment—the benefits most definitely outweighed the costs.I’m certainly not implying that excavation is a perfect analogy to hiking up a mountain.  But as with excavation, there are some things that you can only learn by moving forward and doing.  I can tell you, for example, that the journey to the mosque at Jebel Harun is meant to be a pilgrimage. But no amount of descriptions of the loose rocks on steep inclines, no number of photographs of bleached goat skulls along the path can capture what that really means.Like I said, my day today was fundamentally archaeological.  Even on a day off, living on an archaeological project, you breathe and eat and drink and sometimes upchuck archaeology.  But then you hike it, and it’s immediately clear why you dig it.The Living a Day of Archaeology by Hiking to Jebel Harun by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"458","It may sound strange to anyone not involved in archaeology or construction but heritage is considered to be a risk when looking to develop a site. My job is to identify ‘risky’ archaeology before a planning application is made. To that end I spent this afternoon creating a map of all the known archaeology in an area of west central London (a nice bit shall we say) to see what else had been found nearby, and tracing the history of the site back through four centuries of maps.It turns out the site was arable farmland until relatively recently, some distance from Roman or medieval London, and not part of any of the outlying villages which today form part of Greater London. The maps show that it began to be developed in the 18th century, as wealthy types started to build big town houses. For some time there was a coffee shop on the site, a function it still has today, two hundred years later.Using this information, and comparing it to surveys of the current buildings we are able to build up a likely prediction of what might survive on the site, and how significant it might be. And that was my ‘day of archaeology’.The Coralie Acheson: Assessments and Risky Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"459","Unusually mixed day here – started by doing an archaeology handling session with a school group – not something I usually do. With any mixed group, there are always some who want to be there, and some who don’t care, and some who really are not fussed. Two of the boys in the group were really keen – all the questions and quite a few good answers! Real highlight though was seeing the look on ALL the faces, when I pulled out a Bronze Age sword….(which they didn’t handle, as I assumed the teacher wanted to take all of them home again).You can tell if a young student will get the archaeology bug, when you hand them a palaeolithic hand axe, and tell them it was made 200,000 years ago. Watch that sink in, and see the reaction Got a placement student from UCL with me at the moment, and she’s doing very well – happy to lift heavy boxes, and good with kids…useful combo!Day ended showing the placement student our painfully slow database, and stores environmental monitoring systems.

"460","I am a Classical Archaeologist at the University of Sydney in Australia, and work as the Manager of Education and Public Programs at the Nicholson Museum, Australia’s largest collection of Old World archaeological material.  So my ‘Day of Archaeology 2012′ is spent like most others – trying to balance between museum education and archaeological research on the project I am working: excavations of a Hellenistic-Roman period theatre site in Paphos in Cyprus.It has been a flurry of activity at the Nicholson Museum in recent days as we are setting up for a new exhibition on the Colosseum and first century AD Roman daily life.  There is a slight twist however.  We aren’t able to move the real Colosseum to Australia for a temporary exhibition.  So instead ours is made from Lego-bricks.  It is the largest ever Lego construction of an ancient Roman structure so the project has generated considerable media attention in the Australian press, and the telephone has been running hot from interested members of the public (both kids and kids-at-heart) who are keen to see the exhibition when it opens on Sunday.  The actual piece has only arrived today and the museum installation team have been busy all-day installing the Lego itself on its plinth, as well as the exhibition panels which give it context (if you read the panels on Commodus and Titus – they are mine!).  Its one of the great aspects of museum education – finding ways to present historical narratives using museum collections.  And while you could argue that the Lego display is not a ‘real’ exhibition, I would argue the opposite – it will generate excitement amongst visitors, but ultimately it will be the genuine antiquities that will steal their thunder.My tasks today have involved my usual co-ordination of guided school tours through the museum – it is the last day of the Australian school term and if that wasn’t already exciting enough for our visitors today the noises coming from the room where the already near-mythical lego-Colosseum is being set up has all heads turning.  While I am not teaching the students directly myself today (our able team of Education Officers are at work), it is one of the perks of my job – sharing the joys of archaeology with school students anywhere between the ages of 5 and 18, and finding appropriate ways to use our museum collection to explain how the past can be read.  So while the guides are showing eager students through our collections today, I am instead focussing on some of my other administrative and preparation tasks.  I have been compiling the monthly e-newsletter that is sent to all of our followers, updating the museum facebook page and twitter account and taking some photos of the Lego exhibition for the university’s media unit.  In addition I have been working on some educational resources for our guides to use when school visits resume in a fortnight.  The Lego-built Colosseum will be an amazing resource but we want to use it not as a gimmick but as a genuine teaching resource, so using it as a model of the real building what can students learn.  I’ve had some fun with my colleagues too working out some historical anachronism that the builder has added to the model (some deliberate, some we are not so sure!).  Banana sellers in 80AD?Its going to be a fun way to teach!  Bring on the kids I say!Its not all fun and games though – today I have been engaged in some more intellectual and academic pursuits as well (although perhaps not as much time as I would have liked – but hey, there is a new giant lego toy to play with today!).  I am the co-director of the University of Sydney’s fieldwork project at Paphos in Cyprus, where we work under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus.  The project was initiated in 1995 by my mentor Emeritus Professor Richard Green, and we have been excavating and studying the theatre of Paphos and its environs ever since.  The theatre itself was constructed sometime around 300BC and used until the late 4th century AD (albeit having undergone several phases of renovation and reconstruction).People are often surprised to discover the level of activity by Australian archaeologists overseas.  Obviously both contract and research work in Australia (both Aboriginal and historical period sites), but there is a long tradition of Australian archaeologists working in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East.  This includes Cyprus, where a previous professor at the University of Sydney James RB Stewart ran excavations of Early Bronze Age cemetery sites in the 1930s and in the post-war period.  Many of his finds now decorate the Nicholson Museum, and as 2012 marks the 50th anniversary of his death I will be curating an exhibition on the history of Australian archaeological research on Cyprus at the Nicholson Museum to open in November this year.  No Lego in that one!  But still some fascinating stories, and some incredible artefacts, some of which haven’t been on public display for decades.  Although I am not working on the exhibition today, thoughts of it are never too far from my mind!Instead, I have spent a little bit of time today thinking about Paphos.  We have our next field season in October and I have recently accepted student positions, so quite a few of my emails today have been from members of the team with various logistical questions (airfares, accommodation, tasks and so on).  Less an archaeologist and more a travel agent some times!One of the most exciting emails has been from the team architect with a preliminary hypothetical reconstruction of a nymphaeum near the theatre that we have been excavating over the past three seasons. Of course much of it is conjectural at this point, and based upon architectural features that have been found in the rubble of the building (we are arguing over semi-circular niches at the moment!), but it is exciting progress.  I have spend some time developing some questions for him for our next meeting and will probably spend some time on the weekend thinking about it.  This is particularly exciting as I am currently mid-way through writing up a preliminary report on the building for the Report of the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus – the main journal for the archaeology of Cyprus.So a day of Lego, school kids, a reconstruction of a nymphaeum, and planning appropriate air tickets online.  And I get to do it all again on Monday!The A Lego Colosseum and Other Stories by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"461","When a site is being investigated for an archaeological study one very important resource can be old photographs.Photographs record an instant in time which can be invaluable at a later date for identification purposes particularly if the scene photographed has changed greatly over time. Fields may have been ploughed over, buildings demolished or altered or the people depicted have long gone.As cameras became cheaper and readily available more and more people start to take photographs of their relations, friends, homes, towns, excursions and travels abroad. In addition, they also record scenes of particular interest to them and this often includes archaeological remains. This includes the roman mosaic shown below when newly discovered in Box, Wiltshire.Identification, however, can be problematic particularly if the scene has changed greatly over time and is not identified either on the photograph itself or on documentation to accompany it. This can also make dating difficult as can not knowing who the photographer was. Despite this, however, they are an invaluable resource.Some examples of photographs which could be of archaeological interest include some from a collection of glass magic lantern slides ranging from 1890 to around 1914.One of these is of the Box mosaic previously referred to, found in 1898 and now reburied to preserve it from frost damage. Others in this collection where the location is recorded  could also be of use to archaeologists. These include a cottage in  Schull,Ireland, a windmill near Rhyll,Walesand a replica  medieval cross inBristol. The original was moved toStourhead in Wiltshire, while parts of the replica were moved toBerkeley SquareBox Mosaic 1989.176.8.69Cottage, Schull 1989.176.8.5Rhyll Windmill 1989.176.8.17CrossBristol1989.176.8.72Others in the collection are not identified so any help with possible locations would be appreciated.These include:1989.176.8.36 The name of the shop owner is clear but where was the photograph taken?1989.176.8.37  This was probably taken near Warleigh but does anyone know who the people in the photograph are ?1989.176.8.12.

"463","It’s hot.  It’s extraordinarily hot.  The hottest, and driest, summer in recent memory.  The students are aware of this, naturally, and yet they continue to dig.  And talk.  Not only is it hot, and loud, but school kids and tourists and neighbors and rangers and curators and press and colleagues and just about everyone else in the area is dropping by to talk.  They all ask the same thing: “what have you found?”  Each day the answer changes.  The basic sentiment, however, never varies.  By experiencing archaeology first-hand, the students have found satisfaction.Faculty at Indiana University South Bend are working this summer with students in two archaeology excavations, both with significant public components.  The properties (described below) are owned by public institutions, the public is invited to participate fully in the experience, and the results will be publicly and widely distributed.In 1848, Havilah Beardsley and Rachel, his wife, built the first brick house in Elkhart, now known as the Havilah Beardsley House. The Beardsleys and their children would have an immense impact on the community and in some cases, well beyond. The house remains a part of the Elkhart community, serving as one of the museums on the Ruthmere campus.Now within the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, the Bailly Homestead contains the remains of the trading post established in 1822 by Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774-1835). His home was an early center of culture and civilization in a backwoods wilderness, providing a meeting place for both Indians and whites as well as being a stopping place for travellers and missionaries.For more perspectives on what archaeology means to the students, check out the following clips:Sarah M – speaking about sharingBryan – pontificating about playingAmanda – bragging about bonesHannah – preaching about patienceSarah K – discussing diggingRon’s pamphlet about the program  The Working with the Public by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"465","I’m Rena Maguire. I’m almost an archaeologist, as I’m a third year undergraduate in QUB Belfast. My day of archaeology started at 6am. Not usual for an undergraduate, but I like to get a head-start on things by getting out for a few miles cycle on the bike to clear the cobwebs away and keep fit. That’s after coffee and giving morning kissies to my nutty hamsters Mo, Flo and Tim. They’re my surrogate dogs, and I daren’t ignore them! Today I’ve got a meeting with my supervisor, Dr Dirk Brandherm, with regards to research for my dissertation. He’s the metal expert par excellence. This is the start of my third year in QUB Belfast, doing my Archaeology degree, and this summer is all about research and breaking some new ground on my chosen topic.Archaeology isn’t all research – it can be pretty strenuous on excavations, and I’m off on excavation in July, to Flag Fen, Cambridgeshire. It’ll be my first Bronze Age site, which I’m incredibly excited by. I clocked up a fair few excavations last year – Dunluce was my field school in June 2011, then I was off to an island off the coast of Norway, excavating a Hanseatic kontor, or trading post. This was followed by an Early Christian rath at Ballyaghagan. It seems that whatever digs I’ve been on there’s been television cameras there, so even if you haven’t seen my face, my backside has been on most UK TV stations! I love the constant challenges each landscape throws up, so am very thrilled at getting wetland experience at Flag Fen. It’s also one of the eras I’m interested in specialising in. Win/ win situation!I came into academia from working in the entertainments industry, as a mature student, and I love the work. I really couldn’t imagine doing anything else now. Last week I was in Armagh, handling 2200 year old horse harness and drawing it as part of my dissertation. This week I was down in the beautiful National Museum of Ireland, in Dublin, cross-referencing data going back as far as the 1830s. The archives are heaven, the staff incredibly helpful in every way – I love the old fashioned courtesy and grace which exists in this profession.If you’re a book lover, you’d also love the poring through glorious sepia coloured envelopes, smelling sweetly as only old paper in archives can, with fabulously drawn and recorded artefacts. There is an elegance to this kind of research – I get lost in thought among them very easily. To date I’ve found a lot of information which hasn’t been in the public domain, which hopefully will read well after its added to my thesis!I walk over to university in the rain, and get soaked, but I’m pretty happy. I miss Queens when I’m not there regularly, miss the fun, the people and the stimulus. If you aren’t familiar with Queens University Belfast, let me tell you what a really terrific place it is to study archaeology. It was always my first choice as a university, not just because I live here but because it has produced so many great archaeologists. It may be a centre of excellence, but it’s got a great sense of belonging and community.I’ve been compiling a listing of the horse harness pieces of the Irish Iron Age which I’m doing my dissertation on, and having to devise a methodology for its presentation. This has been a most difficult things for me, as I’m very much the kind of person who goes into a situation and makes up a methodology depending on the circumstances of that moment. My supervisor keeps me on my toes and won’t let me away with being as sloppy as my past employment would accept. Order and quantifiable scientific analysis make for good archaeology – things I need to learn!The thing I love about archaeology is that no two days are ever the same. Today, I’m presenting the results of the past two weeks of intense research work. In a couple of weeks time, I’ll be in workboots and vizi-vest, on a fenland in East Anglia. I’ll alternate between computer skills, artwork, hauling spoil buckets about, calculating carbon 14 rates of decay, sorting artefacts out – or like today, learning from Dirk how metal repairs were carried out in the Iron Age depending on the substance the actual artefact is made of. I’m going to see if I can purloin the loan of a piece of harness to get it X-rayed, and analyse how the pieces were actually made. You work hard as a QUB Undergrad ( well, you do if you want to do this thing right). I wont tell lies and say it’s an easy course to do, but the lecturers work ten times harder to pull everything good out of you, and make you into a consummate professional.I would like to go into the academic side of archaeology, but I also love the digging – you have no idea what’s waiting in the soil. It’s like Christmas – with added mud! At Dunluce last year, on the very last day of the dig, I found a rapier, which had been buried under a ruined building from the 1641 Rebellion . God knows what its story is, but that element of humanity and pathos is just one reason why I’m in love with all the processes of this job.So, after I finished exasperating my supervisor about my lack of forethought on categorising artefacts ( filing is not my strong point!), and I resolve to do better next time, I head to a chip shop to grab some lunch. They’re playing a song that somehow always seems to pop up every time there’s some good archaeology about to go down – Nicki Minaj’s Superbass. The song makes me think of all last summers early starts, dressing by the first light of dawn to arrive at excavations; it makes me think of plane rides, and coach rides, and smiling to myself as the sun rises on ancient landscapes, not knowing what the day is going to bring. ‘My heart goes boom-da-boom da boom like super bass’…. yes, actually,it does, when I think of the honour of working with the history of humanity, and learning how to recreate it all again in the present day This work makes me a very happy girl indeed. I’m still only learning, but I know I want to take this to PhD and excel at what I’m interested in .We get to do the best job on the planet, in my opinion, so I’m more than happy to make every day a day of archaeology!The Roadtrips and Research – The Undergraduate’s Tale by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"466","As has already been posted today, the osteo team from Cardiff University are currently out in Turkey, on site at Catalhoyuk and apparently for their day off are lounging by the pool, a particularly difficult task I imagine. As well as the bone-iologists, one colleague is in Iceland working on a site out there and another is currently excavating in Romania. Cardiff is seeming massively unappealing and rather dull at this point in time. Why a PhD in medieval and early post-medieval pottery from Wales seemed a good idea three years ago when I applied for the studentship here is beyond me. Despite my jealous grumblings (mostly to myself as the post-graduate room is so quiet and now to you) this has been an informative, busy and exciting couple of years. Having the ability to spend three years on a subject you love is a luxury and one I keep having to remind myself of in the dark writing up stage. Post-graduate life here in Cardiff has been amazing fun and it is strange to think that that will all have to end once finished. It is quite difficult to watch others around you completing and passing vivas, which ultimately leads to a change in dynamic within the community you live and work in, as well as rely on, to provide support through what can be incredibly challenging years. The post-graduate room here at Cardiff is central to the developing research community and it is where many a thesis has been written and are in the process of being written now. Friendships, relationships and collaborative projects are developed in this room, many of which last beyond the PhD timescale. One collaborative project which has been recognised as important to all who spend time in this room is the Jaffa Cake challenge. We have sampled and tested the full range of Jaffa Cakes available, including the time old favourite McVities as well as the other supermarket alternatives. I’m afraid I don’t have any official stats and as the room is empty have not been able to call for a show of hands today on the matter, but we believe as a collective to have come to a conclusion on the perfect Jaffa Cake: Lidl’s finest Sondey Orange Jaffa Cake. It has the perfect balance of chocolate, orange and soft cake base, none of this slightly crunchy, could actually be stale, quality you often find with the branded variety. I couldn’t imagine doing anything but archaeology with regards to a career and even though the last 6 months have been a struggle, my archaeological spirits have not been dampened, for at least I always know that the post-graduate room (even on a quiet day like today) can provide solace, a friendly ear – when people aren’t on amazing field projects – and a packet of Jaffa Cakes.  The Stuck at my Desk With a Packet of Jaffa Cakes by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"467","My day of archaeology is relatively mundane: I spend most of it working on my dissertation, a look into the transition from slavery to freedom on a 19th century plantation in Southern Maryland. While I love my work, I often get the urge to be in the field, particularly with the weather as wonderful as it has been this week. So, I thought I’d take out my archaeology bag and show you around.The archaeology bag is more than just a bag with your trowels in it: in many ways it is a reflection of what kind of archaeologist you are. I’m one of those guys who likes to have a tool for everything. I am a gadget man, and I’m always on the lookout for a new tool that could help me be a more effective archaeologist, or to be more helpful in the field.My bag is a Mountain Hardware Splitter. I particularly like this bag because it is comfortable and rugged, and can hold a great deal of equipment. It was originally designed for mountain climbers to hold their ropes. It has some nifty features on it. My particular favorite is a system of loops at the top of the inside: I use them to attach carabiners to, and then hang equipment from the carabiners. This way, the equipment doesn’t bunch up at the bottom of the pack. Instead, it hangs, evenly distributed, throughout the entire pack. Not only does this mean things are easy to get to, but it also means that the weight is distributed throughout my entire back, making it easier to carry.Some of my favorite tools include my trowels, which I received during my field school. Some tools I love for their practicality, such as the duct tape or the WD-40 to keep my tools from rusting, or some of the surprises (sham-wows work). Others still tend to be a bit more personal: if you click on the images below, you’ll notice that quite a lot of my tool bag is devoted to reducing perspiration (I have a very efficient personal cooling system). Towels, hats, sweat bands, hydration packs…I even carry a bag of salt with my lunch to replenish what I lose.The tools you carry are also going to reflect where you excavate. I used to dig in Michigan, so foot and hand warmers have become a mainstay in my pack, as have an extra pair of gloves. Now that I’m in Virginia, hydration is the most important part of my kit. In addition to the hydration pack, I typically have two or three water bottles at the ready. A mosquito net has been advantageous in both states.Safety is also a crucial component of the archaeology bag. Mine includes a tiny first aid kit, sunscreen, a hat, gloves for screening (nails and glass can cut), a reflective vest for roadside or hunting ground survey, and a hard hat (or at least, it did…then my dog chewed it up). Archaeology is a physical activity, and you never know when one of these items might be needed.Finally, there’s lunch. It’s important to make sure that you eat an adequate lunch each day, as well as a few snacks throughout. I purchased a lunch bag from Mountainsmith (“The Sixer”) that can adequately hold enough food, snacks, and water, to keep me fueled for the day. It easily attaches to my pack via carabiners if necessary, or I can throw it over my shoulder with the strap. I always freeze one of my water bottles to serve as an ice pack. This saves me some room, and I have ice cold water to drink at lunch time. I also love my Mr. Bento: this contraption will keep food hot or cold for up to eight hours. There’s nothing like pulling out warm soup at lunch time when you’re excavating in frigid temps. The best part about the “Sixer”? It holds exactly six beers for post-excavation relaxing.Feel free to browse the photos below for a glimpse into my bag of archaeological goodies.

"468","It’s been a long time since I’ve gotten my fingernails dirty, drank a cup of cold tea in a trench, or gotten lost trying to find some site that was last visited in the 1960s. Yep, not much call for a Romanist here in the Ottawa Valley. Fortunately what there is call for, is a ‘digital archaeologist’.Learn more about Canada’s Greatest Culture* at Canadian Geographic! http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/so05/indepth/*I’m biased, yes.…and what is that, exactly?Archaeologists have always been at the forefront in riding the latest technology in the pursuit of better understanding of the past. It’s not for nothing that you’re reading a post on a website called ‘Day of Archaeology’, rather than ‘Day of Sociology’ or ‘Day of Canadian History’. So what do I do? I’m not a GIS guy, or a database guy. I’m in the history department at Carleton as their ‘digital humanities’ guy, so I try to work through what new media imply for both the doing of history/archaeology and for our understanding of history/archaeology. I normally blog what I’m up to over at Electric Archaeology and I’d be pleased if you went over there and took a look. Topic Modeling, Agent Based Simulation, Game Based Learning, Augmented Reality, Crowdsourcing, Open Peer Review… all these things are in my baliwick.Today, I’m lesson planning for the fall. My philosophy of teaching has always been to get students doing real work, in the sense that all assignments always contribute to the generation of knowledge. I try to find projects to which their formative and summative assessment exercises may contribute. I’m off in a few minutes to meet the University Archivist, to see if we can use my class (ca 200 students) to crowdsource online transcription and annotation of documents and photographs.Then, I’m looking into buying an autonomous aerial drone for survey work and photography. I want to use the photographs to create 3d immersive worlds that other archaeologists or the public may then explore, for both outreach and research. Then, polishing up an agent-based simulation of Greek amphorae imitation practices.But, given that it’ll be over 30 C today, I think I’ll just end up taking the kids to the river to play, and I’ll come back to my work in the cool of the evening. That’s one nice thing about being a digital archaeologist – I really can time-shift my hours. On the downside, no regular archaeologist I think has ever had months and months of their work destroyed in an instant, as I did earlier this year.Above is yours truly talking about some augmented reality + museum cataloguing I did with my first year students this past spring. The A Digital Archaeology Day by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"469","So the many, many boxes of nails, thank god, are now a distant memory. At the assessment stage we only do a fairly coarse quantification in order to determine the potential of the material for further work. This sometimes just involves weighing and counting the fragments but when preservation is good enough some other data can be collected such as number of complete nails from each context (divided into broad size categories), minimum number of nails and comments on particularly distinctive styles or features. The point of this isn’t to write a definitive account of the use of nails on the site but to assess their potential for further analysis, decide what role they will play in the final publication and how they can help us to address research questions.Unfortunately, it’s probably not worth doing much more work on the Southwark nails as they are in terrible condition. Most are completely encrusted or incomplete and the assemblage is quite small with a maximum of c. 15 fragments from any given context making any inferences of limited value.Much more exciting this afternoon is the Roman glass and glass working waste which will definitely feature in the final publication. As mentioned briefly in my previous post, this seems to be the first Roman glass-working evidence from this side of the river. The types of waste include ‘moils’ (glass from the end of the blowing iron left behind when you crack the vessel off) as well as a variety of melted, fused and runny lumps.  Threads, pulls and trails etc derive from more detailed manipulation of glass during decoration or the addition of handles etc.Glass working waste from Basinghall, London: Threads and Nails( (c) Andy Chopping, MOLA)The assemblage is relatively small so far with only about 25 moils worth of fragments accounted for, each of which equates to a vessel manufactured onsite. This estimate is based on EME (estimated moil equivalent) a technique lifted from pottery studies (EVEs) which is calculated by measuring the proportion of the moil diameter present in each fragment. Of course many more vessels could have been made and the moils recycled or not recovered. Vessels were being made from both naturally coloured blue-green glass and amber coloured glass.Glass working waste from Basinghall, London: Moils ( (c) Andy Chopping, MOLA)The general range of waste types is not dissimilar to those found at the much larger glass-working dumps at Guildhall Yard and Basinghall Street across the river in Londinium (see pictures below) and, like those dumps, the waste was found alongside lots of broken vessel and window glass intended for recycling. Raw Roman glass was brought all the way from the Mediterranean so recycling this ‘cullet’ made good economic sense. Identifiable fragments of bottles, beakers, jugs and jars from amongst the smashed up vessels suggest a probable date in the early to mid 2nd century AD for the glass working.If glass working interests you check out this website http://www.romanglassmakers.co.uk/linksrom.htm and a great little book called Glass workers of Roman London by John Shepherd and my colleague Angela Wardle, which provides an interim popular account of their work on the Basinghall assemblage and the techniques of glass making.  Their work on the final monograph is nearing completion, but luckily the new evidence from Southwark should still just about make it into the gazetteer of glass-working sites included in the text, and contribute to their discussion of the organisation of the industry.That’s enough from me. I don’t have time to tell you about the lamps, finger rings, combs, figurines, crucibles, hairpins, querns, toilet instruments, tools or the large and interesting assemblage of glass vessels I have already recorded from the site. Unfortunately, I can’t even tell you about the cosmetic mortar or the blue blobbed glass beaker, probably an import from the Rhineland, which I recorded yesterday. The whole point of the assessment stage is so we can get our head around what we’ve got, and how best to study and publish it, so if you want to know more you’ll need to hang about. This is certainly shaping up to be an interesting site and I’ve already spent too long waffling here and not enough time doing my glass data entry.Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back and finish this context before the end of the day, so I can get to the pub on time. The Michael Marshall: Assessing Small Finds From Roman London Part 2 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Once a current market value has been established and agreed upon – Shropshire Museums hopes, with the aid of grant funding and local contributions, to be in a position to acquire the hoard. These monies will be paid as a reward to both the finder and also the farmer.For more information on this process and for all your treasure queries see: http://finds.org.uk/treasureThere is a strong local desire to see these coins kept within the county. The hoard will be displayed at several museum sites in Shropshire for all to see.Emma-Kate Lanyon, Head of Collections and Curatorial Services for Shropshire Museums has said“This hoard has thrown light on a dark and turbulent period of our relatively recent history. Like all hoards of this nature we ask the question why was such a large amount of money left in the ground and never retrieved. We hope to find the funding necessary to acquire the hoard and ensure it can tell its unique story as part of our seventeenth century gallery at the new Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery when it  opens at the Music Hall (shrewsbury) in late summer 2013”.More information about Ludlow Museum can be seen here:http://www.shropshire.gov.uk/museums.nsf/open/9409F0EC30A6B0BF80257479005015A2this new museum project can be found here:http://www.shropshire.gov.uk/museums.nsf/open/07683EFB8004F5BA8025765D003D4319Peter Reavill29th June 2012The The Bitterely Hoard – Part Six – What happens next by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"471","The afternoon starts with some copyediting – not exactly glamourous but something which forms the backbone of publication. Although all of the nine panels reports for ScARF are now finished and available for download there is still some work to be done on text that has come in since the deadline for publication.This text is ultimately destined for the next version of the pdfs, but this will not happen straight away. Instead, the updated text will go straight onto the wiki so it can be seen as quickly as possible. Copyediting means looking over the text to check for things like spelling, grammar, punctuation and terminology. In the case of ScARF it also means doing the formatting. The really short piece I’m updating this afternoon won’t take long, unlike the 800,000 words that make up ScARF in total!The text in Microsoft WordThe next stage after that, and one unique to the wiki version of the text, is the HTML mark up. One of the many fantastic things about the ScARF wiki is that bibliographic links, links to CANMORE records and links to other projects are all made from within the text.You can see in the screenshot here that hovering over a bibliographic entry brings it right up so you do not have to interrupt your reading – pretty cool!The same text in the wikiThis takes some HTML wizardy though, which one of my colleagues likened to looking into the matrix…The HTML mark up for the same text!..but you’d never know that reading it! This sort of ‘hidden’ work might be unique to archaeological reports that are going online, but I think it is just as worthy as excavation – after all, if things don’t get written about, the wider world would never know about them! The Friday fun in the ScARF office – part 2: one for the geeks! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"472","So, now you know. The Tooth Fairy is an archaeologist.Archaeologists get everywhere. Like sand. This also applies to  jobs, so it’s not totally impossible that someone who specialises in the minute structures of teeth (see my previous post from DayofArch 2011) would end up in the overwhelmingly awesome Human Origins Research Group at the Natural History Museum, London.For starters, this is an awesome place to work. Yesterday I found out that during WWII, the collections were evacuated to stately homes across the country to escape the Blitz… complete with associated researchers. And there’s a basement here that’s really a bomb shelter which was used by Churchill as a telephone exchange – part of the secret tunnels which run all under this area up to the Palace and War Rooms. Herman Hess apparently even spent a few nights in the Anthro Stores before his trial.And today, on the Day of Archaeology, this particular Tooth Fairy is gearing up for more research than you can shake a stick at. In relation to the main project I work on at the NHM I’ve:uwrapped my new camera toy;eaten cake and discussed human origins/Euro2012; anddiscovered a disturbing image mode setting on the new camera.I’m also getting ready to go out to the field to look at the teeth of children who died in central Anatolia (Turkey) sometime between 10,500-8,500 years ago.  These are the remains of subadults from the amazing site of Aşıklı Höyük, the earliest settlement of the Anatolian Plateau.I’ll be looking at the microscopic records of growth captured on every tooth–perikymata–to see how these children lived and grew. Like tree-rings, the lines on the outside of our teeth give a lot of information on how we grew (here‘s a more in-depth explanation). It’s a way to find out about health and development in early childhood at the very beginning of human settlement. Were there lots of growth disruptions? Can we see records of illness that might suggest seasonal diseases related to shifting subsistence patterns? That tell us about birth spacing?I’m excited to find out. Even if I will totally get green dental impression material all over my nice new lab coat. It’s the price you pay for science!Anyway, my days are pretty varied, but you can certainly keep up with me @brennawalks, or follow @ah_arkeoloji for more on Aşıklı Höyük. N.B.

"473","I am a first year PhD student, based at the Web Science Doctoral Training Centre  and the Archaeological Computing Research Group at the University of Southampton. My research looks at Linked Open Data and literary compositions from ancient Mesopotamia, written  in cuneiform. Today, I’m going through some translations of Sumerian narrative mythologies in order to identify one that I can use as a case study  to compare and contrast different ontologies for the representation of the same text.It’s been a whirlwind couple of weeks, starting off with the amazing LAWDI (Linked Ancient World Data Institute) at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) in New York, at the end of May 2012. Other lawdites have already mentioned it (see, for example,  Archaeological Computing and Linked Data), and I too, immensely enjoyed listening to colleagues talk about their research and interests in Linked Data and archaeology. For me, it was a fantastic opportunity to meet experts and discuss my ideas and approaches with  the community of specialist working on and implementing projects so relevant to my studies.Later on in June, I had the opportunity to give a paper at acm Web Science 2012 in Chicago. The three weeks in between WebSci12 and LAWDI were spent touring Philadelphia, Washington DC, Virginia, Toronto and finally Chicago. Museum visited included the Met, the Penn Museum and the science centres at both Toronto and Chicago. I also went to the Field Museum, and saw the most complete T rex skeleton ever found, Sue.At the Penn, I met up with fellow lawdites, Steve Tinney and Brad Hafford (Ur Digitization Project), and got to see one of the coolest pieces of archaeology, ever: a terracotta “squeeze”. On the one side, it is an impression of an earlier, Old Akkadian (3rd millennium BC)  inscription, on the other, is an explanation in Neo-Babylonian (from c. 500BC). The image on the left is the impression of the Old Akkadian, the one on the right is the Neo-Babylonian…Apologies for sacrificing correct orientation for the sake of aesthetics!Yesterday, I had the chance to describe my research and share my thoughts at the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College, London.  This continued on as a discussion about narrative ontologies – think Ontomedia, and the like.Next week, no rest for the wicked. I’m enrolled –  and very much looking forward to! – the Digital Humanities Summer School 2012 at Oxford (DHOXSS).     The Ontologies and Cuneiform by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"474","Welcome to the Archaeology Data Service (ADS)  Day of Archaeology blog 2012If you want a quick introduction to the ADS and what we do see last year’s post.We have contributions from two members of staff from the ADS this year, one from Stuart Jeffrey ADS deputy Director (Access) and one from Ray Moore one of the ADS Digital Archivists.Stuart JeffreyAnother busy day at the ADS today, lots of looming deadlines and lots of work to be done.  Since the last Day of  Archaeology the ADS has continued to expand its collections and participate in more and more national and international projects, which is great news and it certainly keeps us out of mischief. In terms of recognition for ADS’s work, it’s actually been a very good year too, the ADS was a major part of the submission that got the University of York’s Department of Archaeology a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education and we are also short listed for a BAA award for innovation (to be announced on 9th July, so fingers crossed!). The project that is occupying most of my time today is the Economic Impact of the ADS project. The ADS is a free to access digital archive, but it’s really important to us, and funders, that we have a good idea of what the actual economic value to the whole sector of the ADS actually is, so we have embarked on a JISC funded project to try and find out, it’s no easy task to try and put numbers on this kind of ‘value perception’.  I’m preparing for a meeting with John Houghton the Professor of Economics (from CSES in Australia) who is carrying out the analysis for the project in Oxford on Monday. This will be our first meeting since the on-line survey of users and depositors will have closed and I’m really looking forward to seeing the responses. (BTW is closes tonight so if you want to participate there is probably a bit of time left, follow the project link above).A nice image from the ADS archive, Cloonsharragh, Ireland, Copyright Clive Ruggles, image taken from ADS ImageBankAlso today, I’m also putting the finishing touches to a joint application, with Internet Archaeology, for an IfA HLF work place learning bursary. We have hosted a couple of these in the past and have always enjoyed the experience of giving someone the opportunity to bring on their skills in a work place environment. We also think there is still a skills gap in the archaeological work force when it comes to digital data management, especially the complexities of digital archiving, and managing data and understanding archiving should really be core skills for archaeologists.I’d also like to mention the fact that the ADS are proud to support the Day of Archaeology. We’ve been really impressed with the response to the Day of Archaeology project in general and the way a ‘snapshot’ of archaeological activity has been built up covering all sectors including academic, commercial, fieldworkers, specialists, students and curators. As well as fulfilling its role of information sharing and community building amongst the profession, it is also clear that the snapshot created on this one day in 2012 could well become a valuable document for the historians of the archaeological discipline in the future. With this in mind, the ADS are keen to help archive these contributions for the long term. Everyone’s contributions today could well be part of a future research project in 2112!Finally, as we near the end of the month it’s time for me to change the ‘featured collection’ section of the ADS front page. Ray has been busy archiving and validating a lot of Grey Literature reports, our total is now over 17,000 I think, and some of these relate to archaeological work done in advance of the construction work at the Olympic sites in London. Given that the Olympics are nearly upon us it seems a good idea to make the major MoLAS report (533 pages!) on this work the featured collection for July, very topical. Topicality is not always something that easy to manage when dealing with archaeological archives, but we like to give it a try.Details of Ray’s Day to follow…….  The The Archaeology Data Service, Working to Keep Your Bits in Good Order by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

I am really looking forward to this conference as it will be my first after Bess was born. She and the husband are coming along (not to the conference itself   ) too so we might be doing a bit of sight seeing while we are there.The title of my paper is: ‘ Aiding the interpretation of ancient documents’ (its on the Thursday at 11am if anyone is there and interested) and its all about decisions/interpretations in Humanities,  how we remember our interpretation (or get a computer program to do it) and how we can store these interpretations/decisions and retrieve them when we need them again. It is a round-up of my PhD research in Ancient History at University of Oxford (also part of the now concluded eSAD project).The stick-(wo)man (I clearly can’t draw and I don’t care) is a documentary scholar but could just as easily be an archaeologist asking: ‘why did I think this context was a part of house A last week when it is so clearly a part of house B today?’. My research took place in the field of Ancient History so is aimed at documentary scholars mainly. However, the conclusions draw in a much wider audience from all over Humanities as decisions in Humanities are usually interpretation-based and:SubjectiveHave very little supported materialAre near impossible to quantifyAre difficult to mapIf you would like to know more – let me know!

"477","As we work closely with archaeological planners and advisors, particularly the English Heritage Greater London Archaeological Advisors in London, the scope of all of our fieldwork and post-excavation strategies follow nationally agreed strategies, we have a really structured process that guides us through the excavation and analysis works. So my specialist osteological analysis and reporting will tie in to specific research questions generated for each site. On large projects like our post-medieval cemetery excavation in Bethnal Green, I will also engage with other specialists, particularly our small finds specialist, Helen MacQuarrie, who will be looking at the coins, dress accessories such as hair combs and buttons that we found with the burials, and our dendrochronologist Anne Crone, whoAn adult skull which we found with a coin in each eye orbit for the symbolic payment for transport into the afterlife. Copyright AOC ArchaeologyVariation in coffin decoration from post-medieval burials excavated from Bethnal Green, London. Copyright AOC Archaeologyhas been working to identifying the species that were used for the manufacture of wooden gravemarkers, which we also found at the site. Anne is also blogging about her day today – worth having a look. And I’ve uploaded a picture of one particularly interesting burial we found with a coin placed in each eye orbit as a symbolic payment for transport into the afterlife.As an osteologist, I also look into the variation in funerary practices that were adopted in the past. The Bethnal Green burials were interred in wooden coffins, mostly covered with an outer textile that tends not to survive very well. The textile was held in place by upholstery pins and the coffin makers placed the pins in a range of patterns to add a bit of variation to the design of the coffin. Additional metal decorations were added, including angels and urns with flowers as well as sun-rays and rosettes. It’s interesting to see if the construction and decoration of the coffin varied, either between the sexes or by age or showed any variation across different sites.  So after recording each skeleton, I’ll catalogue the coffin size and decoration from site records and photographs and hopefully quantify the changes. You can see the variation in the coffin decorations in the site photo and this is generating a mass of data that will hopefully provide some really interesting results. Some of the burials had surviving coffin plates, which tell us the name and date of death of the individual. We can try and identify these individuals in the surviving parish records such as birth, marriage and death records, the census records, parish rate books and in wills, to try and broaden what we know about their lives. At the end of the analysis, we will bring together all of the research and evidence in a site-specific monograph, so the results will be fully accessible in the public domain together with the archived finds, which will be deposited at the LAARC.The And all the other bits! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"478","This Day of Archaeology doesn’t see me out surveying or excavating, nor in a lab.  Instead, it finds me sitting at my desk at MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online at Michigan State University in front of my Mac Book Pro, two large Apple Cinema Displays (powered by an old, yet remarkably reliable, Mac Pro), an iPad, an iPod, an Android handset (Droid X2 if you are interested), and a Galaxy Tab 10.1.  This (extremely technological) state of affairs results from the fact that its been a long time since I’ve actually stuck a trowel in the ground.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a great field archaeology pedegree.  I spent my elementary, highschool, and undergrad years (my father is an archaeologist as well) working on sites in the Northern Plains (mostly Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta – and a little bit in Montana and North Dakota).  As a graduate student, I worked in Indiana and Illinois.  My primary area of research as a graduate student (as well as my archaeological heart), however, rested in Egypt – Predynastic Egypt to be precise.  I worked several seasons with Fred Wendorf and the Combined Prehistoric Expedition at Nabta Playa.  The bulk of my work in Egypt, however, was at Hierakonpolis, where I excavated a variety of Predynastic household sites and did research into Predynastic household economy.As a graduate student (and even as an undergrad, to be quite honest), I found myself increasingly interested in how information, computing, and communication technology could be applied to archaeology for teaching, research, outreach, and scholarly communication.  Fast forward several years and I find myself sitting at my desk at MATRIX in front of a dizzying array of devices.  My transformation from a “traditional” archaeologist (if you will – though, to be honest, is there really such thing as a “traditional” archaeologist) to a digital archaeologist is complete.My office at MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online at Michigan State UniversitySo, what exactly do I do? Well…lots (probably too much given the little amount of sleep I get – but such is the life an an academic). The first hat I wear is that of Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Michigan State, where I teach your usual variety of archaeology classes – including Intro to Archaeology,  Archaeology of Ancient Egypt (which I also teach as an online – and completely open access - class), Rise of Civilization, and Pseudoarchaeology: Temples, Tombs, and Spaceships. I also teach the Cultural Heritage Informatics Fieldschool, which dovetails with the next hat I wear – the Director of the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative at MSU. Hosted by the Department of Anthropology in partnership MATRIX, the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative is a platform for interdisciplinary scholarly collaboration and communication in the domain of Cultural Heritage Informatics ay MSU. In addition, the initiative strives to equip students (both graduate and undergraduate) in the many cultural heritage focused disciplines at MSU (Anthropology, History, Art History, Classics, Museum Studies, Historical & Cultural Geography, etc.) with the practical and analytical skills necessary creatively to apply information, communication, and computing technologies to cultural heritage materials, influence the current state of cultural heritage informatics, and become thought leaders for the future of cultural heritage informatics. The second aspect (building capacity among students) occupies most of my time.  It includes organizing and running the Cultural Heritage Informatics Fieldschool (which isn’t being offered this summer, but will be offered next summer) and directing the Cultural Heritage Informatics Graduate Fellowship Program.The third hat I wear is that of Associate Director of MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online - MSU’s Digital Humanities center.  As Associate Director, I’m  responsible for a crazy variety of things (MATRIX is a pretty democratic place in which everyone works on whatever needs to get done, regardless of whether it is “officially” within their bailiwick or not).  When I’m wearing my MATRIX hat (I don’t really ever take it off) I manage projects, develop grants, write grants, develop strategic partnerships (both inside and outside the university), manage our human resources, and clean up the conference room as needed (like I said, we all do what needs to get done around here)So, what am I actually doing on this Day of Archaeology?  Well, I’m preparing msu.seum (the mobile app developed during the Cultural Heritage Informatics Fieldschool last summer) for official release (which basically means I’m spending a lot of time working in XCode), finishing up the narrative on two NEH Preservation and Access grants that MATRIX is working on with faculty from Art History and History, working on several of my “own” digital archaeology projects (including an open access, born digital annual publication on digital archaeology), finishing up the report on my NEH funded Red Land/Black Land: Teaching Ancient Egyptian History Through Game-Based Learning project, making sure all of the  Department of Anthropology summer online courses are ready to launch (did I also mention that I manage the department’s online classes as well?), working with a MATRIX’s new student community coordinator on revising the documentation for KORA (MATRIX’s open source digital repository platform) and dealing with the day to day minutia (human resources, strategic planning, financial management & budgeting, apocalyptic server crashes – that sort of thing) of being a baby administrator as well as an academic.So, at the end of the day (well, the day is far from done), I’m still doing archaeology…I’m just doing it digitally. The Doing Archaeology, Digitally by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"479","This summer we are surveying and testing sites on and around the Mohonk Preserve in the Shawangunk Mountains of New York State. Today, actually, we are in the lab, despite it being a beautiful day, because we are between sites, waiting for permission to work at the site we next wish to visit. Our testing at the first rockshelter we worked at this summer involved griding out the space in the shelter and then digging, very carefully, 5 50×50 centimeter squares to determine what sort of remains were in the shelter. Once this was done we decided to dig a number of additional pits in order to fill out our understanding. The cultural materials we found have been brought back here to the archaeology lab at Vassar College to be cleaned and analyzed. They will then be either a) returned to the landowner with a report, b) donated to the Daniel Smiley Research Center at Mohonk, with a report or c) donated to the NYS Museum in Albany, with the report. This will be at the discretion of the owner of the property, but we hope that he will donate them to the Mohonk research center.Yesterday, after the excavation was complete, we returned the dirt to the squares so that the site integrity would be maintained. Today we are cleaning and recording the artifacts. Next week we will start the process all over again at another site.Our major aim in this project is to understand how the prehistoric people of the mid-Hudson Valley used the Shawangunk Ridge in their annual round. It seems like most of the sites were used as winter hunting camps during the Archaic or pre-agricultural period in the area, around 6-3,000 years ago, but very few sites on the ridge have been professionally excavated, so we are collecting more data to verify or amend this picture.We are me, Professor Lucy Johnson, and 4 student Undergraduate Science Research Institute interns from Vassar College.

"480","8AM: As an archaeobotanist I can have a bit of variety in my work schedule. I can be called on to go on site at very short notice, but generally my base is in the office, doing assessments and analysis on any plant remains retrieved from site. I arrive at the office (Museum of London Archaeology) around 8am. First order of business is usually making a cup of tea and eating breakfast while I wait for my computer to boot up. Then I check through any emails that arrived overnight before starting on my current project. The practical work I’m doing today is part of an environmental assessment for a large waterfront site in London. Around 250 bulk environmental samples were taken during excavation at the site. We processed these in flotation tanks and now it’s my job to scan through the clean remains under a low powered microscope to see if they’re archaeologically interesting, recording very broadly what’s present. Once I’ve finished scanning all the flots, I’ll produce tables of the remains and write a report with recommendations for the next stage of work. This might include anything from recommending further archaeobotanical work on certain samples, to beetle analysis or wood species identification.Cups of tea: 1. My work space10 am: I’ve assessed two flots so far this morning – I could easily have spent much longer on them, but keeping to deadlines and budget is very important in commercial archaeology. Both samples contained lots of stems, some meadow type taxa, bran (the outer layer of cereal grains) and some fruit remains like fig seeds and apple endocarp (the tough bit around the seeds). At this stage I’d suggest they might be mixed dumps of stabling waste and household waste, but I’ll leave it to the analysis stage to really investigate.Cups of tea: 2Flots assessed: 2 12pm: Not much to report I’m afraid. I’ve assessed two more flots, one with quite a lot of wood chips in it, which might suggest woodworking at the site. At least all the flots have lots of plant remains though! I’ll often have to slog through loads of samples with nothing interesting at all turning up. I’ve also been reminded of one of the perils of being married to another archaeologist – I have been tasked with carrying a metal detector home on the bus so he doesn’t have to come in to the office on Monday morning to collect it himself.Cups of tea: 3Flots assessed: 4 12.30pm LUNCH!Cups of tea: 5Flots assessed: 4.5Lunchtime conversation topics: Tim Burton movies, Start Trek TNG, cheese fondue. 2pm: Still plugging away at the flots, and am now assessing one that’s full of charred wheat chaff as well as waterlogged wood chips. A pretty odd mix, but then all sorts of things float up on a river bank, as anyone who’s taken a walk along the Thames foreshore could tell you. I’ve also fielded a few tech queries from one of the less IT literate of my colleagues here, and a phone call about flotation tank meshes. Ah, the adventurous life of an archaeobotanist.Cups of tea: Still 5Flots assessed: 6 3.30pm: Had a good chat with our timber specialist about exotic wood timbers (exotic for us being anything not native to the British Isles). Working in London, which has been a trading hub since the Romans founded the city in the first century AD, means that we get woods from all over the world turning up in excavations, particularly in postmedieval deposits. Wood species ID is another one of my jobs at MOLA, so we often work together on assemblages.Cups of tea: 6Flots assessed: 8 3.30-4pm: For the last half hour of my working day I’ll be replying to emails, tidying up my workspace and washing my lab ware, and filling out my timesheet for the week. And maybe I’ll squeeze in one last cup of tea.The A Day in the Life of an Archaeobotanist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"482","My name is Anne Crone and I am a post-excavation project manager at AOC Archaeology Group, working in their Loanhead office in Scotland. I am currently managing a number of large post-excavation projects, the most important of which is the Cults Landscape Project – important to me because I also carried out the fieldwork in partnership with my colleague, Graeme Cavers, and because it has enabled me to ‘indulge’ many of my research interests, in crannogs, waterlogged wood and dendrochronology.The Cults Loch crannog under excavation The fieldwork project has involved the excavation of a number of sites in and around Cults Loch, a small kettlehole loch at Castle Kennedy, near Stranraer in south-west Scotland. The project arose out of the initiative of the Scottish Wetland Archaeology Programme, the aim of which was to more fully integrate wetland archaeology into more mainstream ‘dryland’ archaeology. So we selected a landscape in which the archaeological sites appear to cluster around the loch and within which there were two crannogs – these are man-made islands found only in Scotland and Ireland and which are repositories of all sorts of waterlogged organic goodies!  We have excavated one of the crannogs which sits on a little man-made promontory jutting out into the loch, the promontory fort that lies on the other side of the loch, overlooking the crannog, and one of the palisaded enclosures that lies on the grassland around the loch.And now we are halfway through the post-excavation programme.  We know that this is a later prehistoric landscape because we have 1st millennium BC radiocarbon dates from the promontory fort and crannog. But more exciting – I have been able to dendro-date some of the oak timbers from the crannog and we now know that most of the building activity took place in the 2nd and 3rd decades of the 5th century BC, and that there was refurbishment of the causeway in 193 BC – for me these more specific dates bring the occupants more clearly into focus…Today – well, it started off with a 3 mile walk to work – usually a great start when I can think through my schedule for the day – but today the heavens opened and I was soaked by the time I arrived at the office! After drying out I settled down at my desk to read the report on the soil micromorphology from the crannog which my colleague Lynne Roy has just finished. As project manager I need to edit and check each report before it is sent out to the client, in this case Historic Scotland, but as the archaeologist I also want to read it for the insights it will give me into the taphonomy of the deposits on the crannog. And it is really fascinating! We found large patches of laminated plant litter, interspersed with gravel and sand layers which we interpreted as floor coverings that had been repeatedly renewed. Lynne’s analysis has revealed that the occupants probably cleaned away as much as possible of the dirty floor coverings before scattering over a sand and gravel subfloor and then laying down fresh plant litter. She can tell which surfaces were exposed for a length of time while others were covered almost immediately. And her work on the hearth debris indicates that peat turves were probably the main form of fuel on the site.Recording timbers in the warehouse Like many archaeologists the majority of my time is spent at my desk, writing reports, editing reports, filling in/updating spreadsheets, and dealing with emails. So it is a pleasure to be able to don my lab coat and spend some time in our warehouse handling waterlogged wood. I am currently writing the report on the structural timbers from the crannog. The majority of the timbers were undressed logs or roundwood stakes, mostly of alder and oak, so most of the recording and sampling was done on the crannog. Samples for dendro and species identification were brought back to the lab but we only brought back complete timbers which displayed interesting carpentry details and were worthy of conservation. I have been completing the recording of these timbers and deciding which ones should be illustrated for the final report. There are some interesting timbers in the assemblage –large horizontal timbers with square mortises, presumably to take vertical posts, but what is the function of the horizontal timbers which have very narrow notches cut diagonally across them? Next week I will be off to the library to look for comparanda and to find explanations for some of the more unusual aspects of the assemblageRead more about Cults Loch here The Waterlogged Day, Waterlogged Wood…. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

One of the many sites I photographed, the Grey Cairns Of Camster stand out. Not only are they constructed beautifully, it is amazing that they have stood so long intact considering the desolate and remote area they are in. The weather for instance should have been a factor in their ruin. It was a tight squeeze to get in and quite difficult to light and photograph it to show of the fine features.

"484","Now onto our Metal store – this entire store holds a host of treasures, and more coffin nails than you’d care to imagine!Our first lucky object from shelf 496 comes from site ABO92 – Abbott’s Lane, excavated in 1992 by the then Museum of London Archaeology Service (MOLAS). Being a waterfront site this excavation produced a wealth of metal objects – all surviving due to the aerobic conditions of burial.Our object is a medieval pilgrim badge that depicts the mitred head of Thomas Becket dating to c.1530 – 1570. An additional badge of better condition was also excavated from the site. The cult of Thomas Becket was one of the most popular in London during the medieval period – not surprising as he was also considered the city’s unofficial patron saint. These badges would have been collected at the site of pilgrimage – this one may have therefore travelled all the way from Canterbury in Kent, before being lost or perhaps purposefully discarded. The badge is a miniature imitation of the reliquary of a life-sized mitred bust of Becket that was held in Canterbury Cathedral. Lead pilgrim badge, depicting the mitred head of Thomas Becket dating to c.1530 – 1570, and from shelf 496 of our metal store Publication photograph of a similar pilgrim badge to the one found on our shelf (MOLAS Monograph 19)Our second object, stored on shelf 593, is from the more recent excavation SAT00.

Our sundial, excavated from the site of St. Paul’s Cathedral Crypt (SAT00), has a direct parallel with one found in Surrey.Quoting from PAS object entry SUR-7790B4:“These sundials are known as simple ring dials or poke dials (‘poke’ being an archaic word for pocket). The sliding collar would be set into position for the month of the year and, when the dial was suspended vertically, the sun would shine through the hole in the lozenge-shaped piece, through the slot, and onto the interior of the ring. The hour could then be read by looking at the closest gradation mark to the spot of light on the interior of the ring.”http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/492755Next it’s our Textile artefacts.

"485","Just finished recording a juvenile skeleton with lovely skeletal preservation, which meant a range of pathological changes were clear. The most obvious change was destruction of the bone at the base of the tooth root for the second deciduous molar in the mandible, with the bone destruction surrounded by a layer of porous new bone formation. The tooth crown had been destroyed by caries (cavity) and it seems likely that a secondary bacterial infection had developed into an abscess, which had drained into the surrounding gums. This is quite a severe change considering the pattern of tooth eruption suggests the child was only aged about 4-5 years when they died.This particular child had also suffered from previous episodes of disease; their leg bones, particularly the femora (thigh bones), showed marked bending most likely indicating a vitamin D deficiency rickets. We need to form vitamin D either in our skin following exposure to the sun or from our diet, oily fish and eggs containing natural sources of vitamin D. A poor calcium intake in the diet may also be an important factor influencing the onset. It’s likely that a range of factors such as poor living and working conditions, limited diets and increased air pollution during the post-medieval period contributed to cases of rickets. There were also plaques of bone formation over the inside of the cranial bones, with prominent outgrowths forming in the occipital bone at the base of the skull. The deposits were thickened and formed of a long-standing remodelled bone layer, which suggests they had survived with the cranial inflammation or non-specific infection for quite some period.Bone destruction at the base of the tooth roots and porous new bone formation caused by infection from a dental abscess in a child’s mandible.

A field I might add with no shade and the weather prediction is that it is only going to get hotter… am mentally preparing for days of slapping on sun cream factor 50 only to have it trickle into my eyeballs with sweat whilst I am marching up and down in lines conducting a magnetometer survey in Interamna Lirenas, near Monte Cassino, Italy.I have already had a taste of the heat at Segni, Lazio. Perched on a hilltop, this Roman colony is exceptionally pituresque and has been partially enveloped in the medieval borgo. The circuit of the town is bounded by a wall of polygonal construction and the large stone jigsaw walls are impressive even to this day. Our work as part of a major new project of the BSR in collaboration with the Archaeological Museum and local council of Segni, was to conduct GPR survey in the towns piazza and adjacent to the robust podium of the temple of Juno Moneta on the acropolis. Closing down roads and piazzas is never popular but we were warmly welcomed. The locals were inquisitive and supportive of our work although many remained unconvinced that pushing, seemingly, a pram across tarmac and cobblestones could ever herald the results we were claiming that this simple manoeuvre would bring. They have a point.But back to my desk, writing up a conference paper with the pit-pat, pit-pat of tennis balls being struck at Wimbledon on the radio in the background. In between rooting through a thesaurus as the heat begins to fry any semblance of a creative vocabulary, there are other things on my to do list for the day. Perhaps the most daunting task I have is the initial stage of securing and organising new projects. Funding, as we archaeologists all know, is rather scant so trying to maintain a steady income to cover our salaries and costs is a nerve-wracking job. Although we run our geophysics programme as a non-profit enterprise we do have real costs and it is always a delicate balance between fixing a price and ensuring that we can do the project to our professional level on the budget in hand.

"487","I’m very lucky to have a job that I absolutely love doing. My role is to excavate and analyse the human remains that we find across our archaeological sites. It can be a diverse role – last week I looked at an Early Bronze Age adult cremation burial, next week I’ll be looking at some medieval burials found underneath a chapel floor. But today I’m studying one of my favourite groups – post-medieval burials fromLondon! The bone surface preservation is usually really good in post-medieval burials, which means we can see a great range of things on the skeleton, whether it’s a slight developmental anomaly or a more severe pathological change.The skeletons I’m looking at are from a former burial ground dating from 1840 to 1855 from Bethnal Green. The ground was privately owned by a pawnbroker – he clearly saw an opportunity to make some money from the high mortality rates in the parish and surrounding area! We excavated the burial ground over six extremely muddy months last year, prior to the building of a new nursery school on the site. As you can see in the site photo, we’ll uncover and clean the coffins before recording and photographing them. We recovered just over 1000 burials; some of the graveshafts contained up to 54 burials and were up to 7.5m deep.When back in the office, having cleaned the skeletons, I’ll start by laying out all of the remains and then producing an inventory of which bones are present or missing. Post-medieval burials wExcavating and recording post-medieval burials from Bethnal Green, London. Copyright AOC Archaeology Group.ere often placed in vertical stacks in graveshafts, which sometimes collapse over time. So I’ll look for any possible mixing between the bones (if I have three skulls for one burial there’s a problem!) and I’ll check the site records, which will indicate if a coffin was damaged or had collapsed. I’ll then assess the bone preservation and estimate the age and sex of the individual as well as taking a host of measurements – for this site I’m particularly interested in seeing how well the juveniles were growing compared to other groups or compared to modern studies.The best bit of the job, for me, is to determine how healthy individuals were in the past. I’m a true geek and I’m fascinated by how the skeleton can respond to disease processes and how, by recognising and recording those changes, we can help to reconstruct a bit more about what life was like in the past. I admire fieldwork archaeologists – how they can look at a hole in the ground and work out what activity had taken place on the site – but I love that my work has a more personal aspect by looking at the evidence from the people themselves. It’s a very emotive subject, but hopefully by trying to ascertain as much as about them as possible, as carefully as possible, we are gauging a respectful and fascinating insight into their past lives.Right – ready for the first skeleton of the day. I’ll complete a paper-based record for each skeleton, which forms part of the site records that are archived with the relevant museum when the project is finished, in this case the London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, so if anyone needs any further information they can directly access the records. We also have a specific osteology database for generating our report data, which can get big depending on how many pathologies there are on a skeleton or how long-winded I’m being. I’ll update the blog later on to show you what I’ve found.

This is artist Jeremy Deller’s Sacrilege, and today it’s in Marlborough, home of the sarsens (who needs bluestones anyway?). As it was being set up, the weather was pretty dire, windy and wet. But around 10 it cleared, and now it’s windy and periodically sunny. Stonehenge will be in Marlborough until 6pm, and it’s free (just take your shoes off).Sacrilege, in case you’ve missed it, is a full scale Stonehenge bouncy castle (all the upright sarsens), launched in April at the Glasgow International Festival of Visual Arts, and now on tour. There aren’t many venues, so we’re very pleased to have it here for the day (you can find the tour list by Googling, or visit my blog; all archaeologists, of course, will have read my interview with the artist in British Archaeology for May/Jun this year, when Sacrilege was still embargoed).It’s quite wonderful. It’s huge fun – you don’t see a glum face anywhere near it, and of course kids love it. It’s a focus, if you want it, for discussions about heritage values and meanings. And it’s a an “engagement” project that really works. You get to bounce around in the parts that most people never see in the real thing, if they see it at all, and it’s so huge and realistic that the curious are often going to want to know more. I asked a group of swaying primary school children this morning how old they thought the real thing is? We narrowed it down to between a million years and 30 years.

"489","One of my technical specialties is high-powered microwear analysis, a method by which the function of chipped stone tools can be determined. Pioneered by Semenov (1964) and refined by Keeley (1980), the high-powered magnification approach has repeatedly demonstrated that variability in polish formation on utilized surfaces is related to tool use on different materials (e.g. soft tissue, hide, bone, wood, etc.). Striations, or the grooves and scratches of varying orientation and dimensions which often result from abrasive forces imparted during tool use are important indicators of intentional and unintentional motion, such as friction between a stone tool and its haft and/or the contact material being worked.  Taken together, micropolish and striations provide information on contact material, tool motion, and hafting.  In this manner, the identification of distinct surface and edge alteration of tools can be related to prehistoric patterns of activity and raw material use and utilized in the reconstruction of the organization of cultural behaviors.Today I continue to work on material from three sites. Two sites were recently excavated by a Cultural Resource Management firm as contract excavations. These sites, which date from the Late Archaic and Woodland periods, were investigated to fufill compliance laws prior to disturbance. As part of the data recovery plans, the principle investigators have included a budget for analysis, a part of which is microwear analysis to determine the function of chipped stone tools recovered on site. A range of formal and informal tools were recovered, and so far, results indicate a wide variety of tasks  including butchery, hide,  and bone and wood working occurred on site.The third site I am working on is the famous Lindenmeier Folsom site in Colorado. These materials were excavated and/or collected in 1934-40 during work at the site by Frank Roberts. Microwear analysis of a sample of endscrapers recovered from the site reveal that many of them were employed in the later stages of hide working. Edge wear in the form of eroded resharpening scars and heavily rounded edges along with a well formed dull-pitted polish characteristic of dry hide was present (see photomicrograph).  During late stage hide working, the edges of the tools are allowed to dull, so that accidental tearing of the hide during stretching and softening is lessened. Some endscrapers were discarded with sharp, fresh edges indicating use during earlier stages of hide working where cleaning and thinning is the object. These discard patterns illuminate the activities that took place on site, and when coupled with an assemblage of worn out, broken and discarded projectile points suggest active hunting and transport of fresh hides for processing at the site was common.  Here is a prime example of the value of why collections should be curated, as when they continue to be available for analysis, we can continue to learn from them.Heavily worn and rounded distal edge of unifacial endscraper used on dry hide.The Microwear analysis-determining the function of chipped stone tools by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The Iziko museum complex comprises a dozen or so sites with South African Museum the primary site. Administratively divided in ‘natural,’ ‘social’ and ‘art’ history, Archaeology provides a vital bridge between these divisions.

I am a dedicated, committed and motivated person, always striving to better myself in all aspects of my life. When I was offered this position of working with the Physical Anthropology Collection, I felt extremely honoured. I work with the deepest respect and discipline because I see myself working with people and not specimens as they were considered to be in the past. I feel very fortunate to have this job of being a part of the repatriation and restitution of all the human remains in our collection. I am very passionate about my work and would like this to be my chosen career path. I am not, in fact, here today – I am on leave – but this is what I did yesterday (and on the days before that):Yesterday started by collecting boxes of human remains from the restricted access section of the storeroom and transferring them to the study area. I checked for potential indicators of unethical collection which means the presence of hair, tissue, personal information relating to the individual such as a name, and/or large number of individuals from the same site. I didn’t find any such indicators, so I didn’t have to call Sven, the Curator and he didn’t have to add to his repatriation list. Thereafter I re-assemble the individual in order for me to establish the possibility of how many individuals might be present in one single box. I then photographed the remains starting with skull (cranial) and then moving on to the post-cranial remains (that is the remainder of the skeletal body). After I have photographed the bones they are carefully packed in acid-free paper. I print a label for each box with all the information found and paste it on the box. At the end of each day, the final step is to capture all the information on my database which I have created.Thank youWilhelmina Seconna: Assistant Collections Manager: Accessioning Historic Cape Town Artefacts and returning display items to storeWilhelmina Seconna in the main store at the education tableI am an Assistant Collections Manager in the Archaeology Unit which consists of a team of six individuals. Together with the Curator, my main function is to see that operations run smoothly. A typical work day in my life is never the same; however, I try to maintain a disciplined and systematic schedule to my days, with Mondays being administrative days when I see to leave queries, registers, post, and emails. Fridays – like today are spent doing intense cleaning and maintenance of our collections stores and exhibitions. My job also requires that I work closely with researchers, assisting them with queries; such as where their material is situated within a space containing over 10 000 boxes. This month we have two long-term researchers in our Unit (this can rise to more than a dozen).For Archaeology Day, I am busy returning artefacts that were on the Made in Translation exhibition of historic rock art copies; to their proper places. Yesterday we received two boxes of artefacts from 18th and 19th century Cape Town from a CRM project and Fosche, Sven and I will this afternoon discuss how best to accession these items. In-between these two tasks is the usual running around printing (printer not working again today!), emails and so on.Before working here, my idea of Archaeology resembled something out of the movies such as Indiana Jones and his quest for discovering lost relics…often made out of gold! Was I in for a surprise when I was introduced to my first “relic” and it was made entirely out of stone; literally, thousands of them, each having their own story to tell. Well, I have come to develop a new-found respect and love for these stones as I am now able to relay their “stories” to others. This, for me is key to being a good collections manager; it’s not just about maintaining good housekeeping standards but also about finding out every “relics” story, making them come “alive” and passing their story on to others, thereby ensuring that they will be cared for appropriately, long after our generation is gone.The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything; they make the most of everything that comes along their way.Fosche Munzhedzi: Department of Science & Technology Intern: Khoekhoe pottery, store mappingFosche Muzhedzi preparing record photographs of Khoekhoe lugged potI am a Limpopo Province-born (South Africa) young man who matriculated in 2005 at Tshiwangamatembele Secondary School, near Thohoyandou.

With the aid of Department of Arts & Culture, Heritage Bursary Programme I enrolled for BA: Archaeology (Hons) at the University of Venda in 2011, expecting to finish late 2012. In early 2012, I was selected for the DST-NRF 2012/13 Internship Programme in archaeology under mentorship of Dr. Sven Ouzman and Wilhelmina Seconna of Iziko South African Museum. Since the Pre-colonial archaeology collection is yet to move pending a major building expansion my main duties today (and most days this month) are:(a) mapping the archaeology store rooms. I make sketch maps of the store rooms. The idea is to enable us to know where exactly to find particular box of material in the store rooms, and also to group them together according to their provenance rather than just alphabetically by site name. That will also help us to locate some collections that were placed randomly not considering confusion and delays in times of research purpose.(b) I am also working with pottery (Khoekhoe pots). Basically what I do here is describing, photographing, cataloguing and repacking the pots. This is good and it makes things easier for researchers who want to access and study the pots.I am also entitled to work with rock art recordings in our collection stores whereby all rock art copies and tracings will be recorded in a database system.Sven Ouzman (the one on the right)Sven Ouzman: Curator: Funding proposal, an irate octogenarian and Historic Cape Town artefactsThis morning I drove to work in the early morning rain. I try get to work early to get a chunk of work done but today the weather made me make a cup of tea and contemplate the day ahead. So far, three teas later and multiple gazings upon the stormy weather outside, I have worked up another draft at a funding proposal to digitally enhance the ~300 pieces of rock art in the collection, subject them to XRF to determine paint recipes and sources; to date wherever organic material occurs and then to digitally repatriate the pieces where possible. This was interrupter by a 13 minute telephone call from a concerned octogenarian who felt I should “fight for the Bushmen” (this brought on both by the decade-long closure of the (in)famous ‘Bushman diorama here and tomorrow’s state funeral for Dawid Kruiper, noted San leader). I then took a break – WAB-ing (Work Avoidance Behaviour) and checked on the rock art and ethnography galleries (they are still there, I checked). Now I am collating the day in Archaeology submission and thereafter Fosche, Wilhelmina (who is the de fact Collections manager) will go through some clay pipes, bones, ceramics etc from a CRM excavation onBree Street, uncomfortably close toPrestwich Street– of the controversial slave and labourer burial site. A person from Noordhoek has just brought in a bovid bone to identify (and by bringing it in, breaking our heritage legislation), and I am negotiating with the museum to fly flags at half mast for Dawid Kruiper’s funeral tomorrow.

"491","Right now it’s winter here in Argentina and we are nearing the end of the first term at the Universidad de Buenos Aires where I teach a year long course in Research Design. Facing me is a pile of my student’s projects to finish correcting by Monday, our last class before the winter break. It is often frustrating but, then again, immensely satisfying when our students finally develop the knack and learn how to put together a solid research proposal. What I most enjoy are the original ideas they bring each year, and being able to keep up with new subjects or research in regions I have little time for otherwise. I enjoy teaching and tutoring.My time in Buenos Aires is mostly dedicated to carrying out analyses and writing about our research in the archaeology of Originary Peoples in Southern Patagonia. The research year for me “begins” in April after our return from the field and I have to begin to download, classify and label all our digital information (photos, GPS data) as well as digitize our field notes. A lot of this goes into Dropbox so all our team can easily access our database. All this last week I have been going over our field notes trying to inventory and choose more samples to date the archaeological deposits. We also have to plan for time writing up our research as well as preparing for two conference presentations programmed for October. All of a sudden the year seems already too short.Our research area is located in Southern Patagonia around lago Buenos Aires, along the Jeinemeni-Zeballos rivers on the border with Chile and the Ghio-Columna rivers flowing into lago Ghio in the area also known as Paso Roballos. Our main goal is the history and rhythm of occupation in the area studying the nature of repeatedly used locations through time and how this relationship with the landscape is played out at different scales in the research area in order to see if whether resource availability or cultural choices are guiding the choice of places to settle.Within our team there is a PhD student analysing the lithic artefacts and another undergraduate training in animal bone analysis. Since continuity in the history of occupation is another guiding concept, another PhD student, a social anthropologist, is analyzing archival material and carrying out interviews to make visible the presence of Originary Peoples in the area during the last two centuries. We are also working with a geographer and a geologist from the Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh to study past changes in the environment and interpret the present day landscape.Lunch break while surveying in the field in Paso Roballos, ArgentinaThe small border town of Los Antiguos in the Province of Santa Cruz  is our base. It means “the Ancient Ones” which seems very appropriate. We are collaborating with the tourism and culture areas of the local Municipality to make a characterization of the archaeological places and objects in the landscape in order to evaluate the management and public use of these resources. Agronomists from the local chapter of the INTA are also involved. This kind of work has just recently placed us in touch with biologists studying the rare endemic Hooded Grebe.It is hard to maintain our presence in these isolated communities. We are typically only there in the summer for our fieldwork and have to dedicate special time to work in town with all these collaborators. It is also the moment we carry out workshops or talks with different groups in the community (e.g., children, teachers, tourists). We are striving to continue writing or producing multimedia material that can be used in schools or for visitors. It helps that the internet has improved and we can now keep in touch all year round by Facebook. There has been a tremendous change in how we are received each year. It has proven invaluable in strengthening our ties and friendships in Los Antiguos.We look forward to the “end” of the year and our long summer field season. It is so far away from Buenos Aires and yet so present all through the year. It is our escape valve from the daily mayhem of the city.

"493"," This section has been written by Jonathon Worton who is a studying for a PhD student at the University of Chester looking at the English Civil War in Shropshire.Shropshire at War: July 1643 – March 1644Speeds Map of Shropshire – Copyright and permission of Shropshire Archives/ Shropshire CouncilBetween July 1643 and March 1644, during the First English Civil War, the military situation in Shropshire changed radically as the war became increasingly hard-fought on Shropshire soil.Since the beginning of the conflict between King Charles I and his political opponents, the king’s supporters in Shropshire had been active and by September had effectively neutralised parliament’s following in the county. On 20 September King Charles, his court and elements of his army entered Shrewsbury. Considerably reinforced, the Royal army marched from the county in mid-October – to fight the first major battle of the Civil Wars at Edgehill in Warwickshire on the 23rd – leaving Shropshire under Royalist control.When in March 1643 the Royalist general Lord Capel took command in Shropshire, there were still no Parliamentarian forces or garrisons in the county. Whilst skirmishing and raids by both sides took place along the Cheshire border – with fierce fighting occurring at Whitchurch and Market Drayton – most of Shropshire was at relative peace. The county was, however, being increasingly exploited to provide money, resources and recruits for the Royalist war effort. In May, Sir William Waller’s Parliamentarian army captured Hereford, and Shropshire’s Royalists feared a Roundhead thrust into the south of the county. Whilst the London press reported the fall of Royalist Ludlow, in reality Waller’s expeditionary force soon withdrew back into Gloucestershire without having ventured onto Shropshire soil.Royalist control in Shropshire was seriously threatened for the first time in September 1643, when a group of local Parliamentarian activists who had been driven into exile in 1642 returned to the county with military support from Cheshire and London. This county committee established a garrison at Wem and fortified the minor market town with earthworks and artillery. The threat to the Royalists’ headquarters at Shrewsbury some eight miles to the south was clear, and on 17-18 October Capel’s army repeatedly attacked Wem. Although greatly outnumbered, the Roundheads beat off the Cavaliers, who withdrew to Shrewsbury having suffered heavy casualties. Defeated in battle, Capel had also become unpopular with Shropshire’s populace – Royalists and neutrals alike – for whom wartime taxation, conscription and other military demands had become an unacceptable burden; after the defeat at Wem, one London news book (the equivalent of the modern newspaper) reported that Capel feared to leave Shrewsbury in case the townsmen barred the gates behind him!Panorama View of Shrewsbury 1630 – 1650 – Copyright and permission Shropshire MuseumsWhilst the situation of the Parliamentarians at Wem remained precarious – they complained they were isolated, short of arms and ammunition and had few local recruits – psychologically they held the upper hand. Lord Capel was recalled to the king’s headquarters at Oxford in December 1643, and there is evidence that without effective local leadership, Royalist support, morale and administration in Shropshire began to crumble. One Cavalier colonel described how the defences of Shrewsbury were in ‘great neglect’. By January 1644, the Parliamentarians were strongly fortified at Wem and had established lesser garrisons in north Shropshire. On the 12th, led by Colonel Mytton, they inflicted a significant defeat on the Royalists at Ellesmere, capturing a munitions convoy, routing the escorting cavalry regiments and capturing a number of high-ranking Cavaliers. To the south of the county, just over the Herefordshire border, was the small Parliamentarian garrison at Brampton Bryan Castle. Having successfully withstood a siege the previous summer, in the New Year the Roundheads at Brampton Bryan raided and plundered Royalist territory and succeeded in establishing an outpost in southwest Shropshire at Hopton Castle.The Royalist high command at Oxford now turned to their most famous general, King Charles’s half-German soldier-nephew Prince Rupert, to restore the military situation in Shropshire. The prince is largely remembered as the most dashing of Cavaliers, famous for his good looks and hell for leather cavalry charges. In reality, Rupert was sober in his habits and suffered fools not at all; a careful administrator as well as a skilled tactician, Rupert was a professional soldier and a charismatic leader who attracted a following of like-minded energetic and ruthless young officers. Appointed by King Charles in January to the regional command that included Shropshire, Prince Rupert arrived in Shrewsbury on 19 February leading at least 700 experienced cavalrymen. Other Royalist reinforcements, from as far afield as Bristol and Ireland, were not far behind. The arrival of the charismatic prince no doubt heartened loyalists and swayed others to the Royalist cause. At Wem, Colonel Mytton feared the power of the prince’s persona, as much as his reinforcements, ‘in regard of the reputation of the man, whose name shouts loud in the ears of the country people’.The influence of the prince was soon felt, with a series of Royalist successes. On 23 February he despatched one of his protégés, Major Will Legg, with a task force of cavalry and infantry to seize supplies of food and fodder from the countryside around Wem, thereby denying it to the Parliamentarians. On 4 March a Roundhead supply convoy was captured near Tong, and the next day Rupert led a raid on Market Drayton, taking by surprise and routing a Roundhead cavalry force encamped there, including a regiment from Yorkshire. Around 18 March the Parliamentarians had established a garrison at Apley Castle near Wellington, but on the 24th a Royalist force, including a Welsh regiment, occupied the town and captured the castle. The following day at Longford, near Lilleshall, 600 Parliamentarians under Mytton were defeated by a similar number of Royalists. With their last mobile force defeated, the Parliamentarians were pinned down in their garrisons. On 24 March Hopton Castle was surrendered after a hard-fought siege, and the Roundhead garrison massacred. In co-operation with Royalists from Cheshire led by Rupert’s deputy, Lord John Byron, the prince’s forces took the minor enemy garrisons in north Shropshire; and by 30 March at Ellesmere, 600 Royalist soldiers from Shrewsbury had joined forces with Byron’s men to threaten Wem. The same day another Royalist officer wrote from Shrewsbury, with obvious enthusiasm, that ‘we shall not be long troubled by our neighbours of Wem’.By the end of March 1644, Royalist supremacy in Shropshire had been largely restored, and the Parliamentarians were contained in their garrisons at Wem, Tong and Longford, and over the Herefordshire border at Brampton Bryan. These remaining outposts soon came under Royalist pressure, and by the end of April, Wem remained once again as parliament’s sole stronghold in Shropshire.Marshall Prospect of Shrewsbury – a view of the town in the restoration?Copyright: Shropshire MuseumsReflections on the Bitterley Hoard – from a County perspectiveFrom the above, it is difficult to attribute the deposition of the Bitterley hoard to a specific military event during this period. Whilst the Parliamentarian garrison at Brampton Bryan was stubborn and determined, it lacked the manpower and resources to range widely into south Shropshire, and would have been checked by the Royalist garrison at Ludlow. For this period of the Civil War in the county most of the fighting occurred in the northern half. Thus, with the exception of the perceived influence of the Parliamentarian garrison at Brampton Bryan – and that of the lesser, short-lived outpost at Hopton Castle – and the ‘scare’ engendered by the brief Parliamentarian occupation of Hereford in May 1643, for much of the period July 1643 to March 1644 south Shropshire must be considered to have been relatively safe for Royalist supporters, with the direct threat of Parliamentarian military action fairly minimal – although of course it is easy to state this with the hindsight of history!There may have been Royalist soldiers from Shropshire who had served in the garrison of Bristol since its capture in July 1643, and later returned to serve in the county. A locally recruited regiment – Colonel Richard Herbert’s – had fought at the capture of Bristol, and may have been part of the garrison for a while. After fighting at Newbury in September, it returned to Shropshire and was, at least in part, in garrison at Ludlow from October. Prince Rupert’s own regiment of foot had been part of the Bristol garrison, and marched from there to Shropshire when the prince assumed command at Shrewsbury. Rupert’s ‘Bluecoats’ may have been in action at Hopton Castle, but were more likely at Brampton Bryan. An officer of the regiment who having been quartered at Bitterley and had hidden his monies there, before leaving to be killed or fatally wounded at Brampton Bryan? –  tenuous, perhaps! Bristol was also a source of Royalist war materiel that found its way to Shropshire via Monmouthshire and Herefordshire.As mentioned, Royalist military taxation became increasingly oppressive. Although in March 1644 Rupert reformed the system set up by Capel, if anything the demands became greater; and doubtless Rupert’s tax collectors were not adverse to seizing what they thought was due and considered had not been paid under the formal collection process. Parliamentarian sympathisers would of course have been under closest scrutiny for concealed wealth, but neutrals and Royalist supporters would not have been immune from these demands, the grinding financial severity of which should not be underestimated. Perhaps the Bitterley hoard is a classic case of wartime tax avoidance?A summary of Jonathon’s current research can also be seen here:http://finds.org.uk/research/projects/project/id/322Peter Reavill29th June 2012 The The Bitterley Hoard – Part Five – Shropshire in the Civil War by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"494","A bronze escutcheon from an Iron Age wine-mixing vessel found in Baldock © North Hertfordshire District CouncilWe archaeologists are constantly reassuring the public that it’s not all about treasure: we are as interested in rubbish (if not more so) than in Tut‘ankhamun’s gaudy baubles. Yet we all go slightly dewy-eyed when something really beautiful turns up, even if we are sometimes ashamed to admit it. A gold stater of Cunobelin found on site will have everyone rushing across to see it: yet another sherd of Harrold shelly ware will not.This isn’t hypocrisy. As I explained in my previous post, most archaeological finds really aren’t suitable for public display. All too often, they consist of fragments – slivers of animal bone, potsherds, rusty lumps of iron – that are, frankly, uninspiring (unless you know what you’re looking at, of course!). When we find something that is instantly recognisable for what it is – a well preserved brooch, a sculpted stone, a complete pot – it really is more exciting. And the good thing, from the point of view of a museum archaeologist, is that it is easier to tell stories about it to non-archaeologists.For this reason, museums tend to display their best looking artefacts. With a collection that is varied, there is almost an embarrassment of riches: we have to pick and choose what goes on display. We also have to pick and choose which items will be priorities in our disaster management plans. Which objects do we save first? The most valuable? The most fragile? The most iconic? It is always a difficult decision and one for which there are no right answers. I have my own personal favourites that are on display, but they are not necessarily the artefacts that would need to be saved first.Tenth-century sword chape from Ashwell © North Hertfordshire District CouncilBecause Letchworth Museum tells the story of North Hertfordshire from the arrival of the first humans (actually most likely members of the species Homo heidelbergensis) over 400,000 years ago through to the turn of the twentieth century, there is an enormous range of objects on display. We have Lower Palaeolithic hand axes from Hitchin, Mesolithic tranchet axes from Weston park, a Neolithic polished axe from Pirton, a Bronze Age Ballintober type sword from Gosmore… By the time we reach the Iron Age, there are so many objects that could potentially be displayed that we are forced to choose the best: we have two cauldrons (one from Letchworth Garden City and one from Baldock), for instance. Pride of place goes to the early Welwyn-type burial from Baldock, which was packed with treasures. Moving into the Roman period, there is a beautiful marble portrait head, probably from Radwell, that is among the finest ever found in Britain.Although the closure of the museum in September will mean that these items will not be available for public viewing again until the new museum opens in 2014, we are working on a digitisation scheme that we hope will make selected parts of the collections available through the web. We are currently looking at collections management systems and web-based solutions for making our huge collections accessible to a wider public. There are interesting (and busy!) times ahead.The Archaeology at Letchworth Museum: telling stories about the past by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"495","‘With every colour in a tartan plaid spread on the sky…’Kevin Grant CBA Bursary Scheme Community Archaeology TraineeOut on the edge of the old world, on the blue-green ribbon of machair and mountains which makes up  the Innse Gall, the barking of a seal punctuates the regular lapping of the Minch in the rugged, rocky, haven of Loch Aineort. Or at least, I imagine it will.In 2 weeks, I head out to my favourite archaeological landscape: Loch Aineort, on the east side of the Island of South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Blogging won’t be easy, given that a phone call can be a challenge there – that’s why I’m writing this pre-emptive blog, which will be posted on my behalf, while I’m cold, damp, and midgey-bitten in my favourite archaeological landscape.The ruins of the inn at Loch Aineort, looking west across the Loch to Hafn, the last spur of land before the open seaLoch Aineort was once the main port for the Uists back in the 18th century, when the MacDonalds of Clanranald wielded their power from here across the seas. The ruins of an inn lie choked in scrub at the head of the Loch, a place where a dry roof and a warm fire would have been heaven for travellers coming ashore from many of the small stone-built and rock-cut moorings nearby. Blackhouses, the low, round ended byre-dwellings of the 18th and 19th centuries, dot the landscape, nestled down against the wind. A glance at an aerial photograph of the area reveals cultivation remains everywhere:  scars left by the Cas Chrom, the foot plough, cover the tiny tidal island of Riosgaigh where 10 crofters had a share of potato-land in 1805.View into the loch from within one of many Blackhouses surrounding the lochThe Loch has bore witness to great events: it was probably from here that Clanranald departed with his men for the Jacobite rebellion and Culloden. One of his men chose Loch Aineort as the setting for what was to become one of the most significant and beautiful poems ever written in the Gaelic language. His description of sunrise illustrates why it is my favourite place: it is the perfect example of a true archaeological landscape: a place where the land, people, and culture are intricately entwined.‘Chrian a’ faoisgneadh gu h-òrbhuidghÀs a mogal…Chinn dach dath bhiodh ann am breacan,Air an Iarmailt’ ‘As the Sun Bust Yellow-GoldenOut of her husk…With every Colour in a Tartan PlaidSpread on the Sky’-Alastair MacMhaistir Alasdair, The Galley of Clanranald c1751 (Trans.

"496","Caution: osteologists at workThe Digitised Diseases project, a collaboration between the University of Bradford, Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) and the Royal College of Surgeons, is producing high resolution laser 3D scans of diseased human bones. These will be included in a medical resource website aimed at informing and teaching doctors and other professionals. The advantage of working with bone from archaeological sites and museum collections is that they can illustrate rare lesion types, some of which may not appear frequently in 21st century clinical medicine. Without access to antibiotics, sufferers of chronic diseases in the past could go on to develop the full extent of bony lesions. Having won JISC funding for the project, the team is currently selecting appropriate examples of pathological change for scanning. Following the excavation of a large number of burial grounds from different periods ofLondon’s history, MOLA is uniquely placed to provide interesting examples of disease for scanning. Each bone is entered into the database which produces an index number. They are then described, photographed and scanned. The photographs are then mapped onto the scans by gaming industry experts to produce the final textured 3D image.

"497","Today is the final day of excavation here on our site in the City where we’ve been digging inside a series of twelve tiny early 20th century coal vaults. We’ve been working in these for the last fourteen weeks and with two archaeologists in each vault friendship is certainly a bonus!Archaeological survival beneath each vault floor has been quite deep (up to 3m in places). Some of the most exciting finds this week were discovered within a deep brick-built cess-pit that had been filled up with a wide range of domestic finds that probably came from the kitchen, the domestic quarters or even straight off the dining table (see photo). The pit had been reused as a rubbish dump in the 18th century and was full of general household detritus, these include a broken metal candlestick (pictured), several glass bottles, a small (possibly delftware) bowl (pictured) that looks like it could have been used as a table item to serve sugar or butter. Several other small fineware vessels including tea cups and egg cups (pictured) were also kept. Two very fine worked bone objects including a dress comb were also collected and two clay pipes were recovered with the bowl and almost the entire stem intact (pictured). The assemblage is exactly the type of thing that archaeologists want to find, as such common items paint an immediate picture of working households; a snap-shot of daily life for the relatively well-off middle classes of 18thcentury London.Andrew up to his elbows in an 18th century brick-lined cess pitSpecial thanks also to Andrew Cochrane (pictured) who is leaving today to take on a new role at the British Museum; his hard work on site over the last 14 months has been greatly appreciated.

"498","I’m Dawn McLaren and I’m a finds specialist at AOC Archaeology Group based at Loanhead, Scotland. On a day-to-day basis I’m principally involved in the post-excavation analysis of artefacts recovered as the result of developer-led excavations ranging from early prehistoric through to post-medieval in date. To give you an idea of the range of finds that I deal with, in the last couple of weeks I’ve been looking at coarse stone tools and querns from an Iron Age settlement, some pottery from a Bronze Age burial and post-medieval metal finds from an urban site in Edinburgh. It definitely keeps me on my toes!  Today I’ve been examining some later prehistoric ironworking waste from a multi-phase site at Beechwood, Inverness and I’m really excited about what it is telling us about metalworking on the site.  The site, which was excavated by my colleague Rob Engl and others, revealed several Bronze Age/Iron Age timber roundhouses, palisades and enclosures together with evidence of Neolithic settlement.Dawn identifying slag from BeechwoodStarting from the beginning, what is ironworking waste?  Basically, it is the non-iron component of ore that is separated out from the iron during smelting and smithing but there is inevitably other associated debris such as bits of ceramic hearth lining and vitrified stone which don’t necessarily need to be connected to metalworking. I’m terribly over simplifying, of course, but I hope this gives you an idea. Visually, this material doesn’t look like much, I admit! It often looks like rusty or glassy shapeless ugly lumps. But I’ve been trying for years to convince people that it’s really interesting and can tell us a lot about metalworking technology.My first step is always to visually examine (macro and microscopically) the individual pieces looking at the colour, texture, shape and how melted and fused the material is. Another important part of the initial identification is to determine whether the material is magnetic. All of this information helps me to split the assemblage into broad categories: what is ironworking waste and what has been formed as the result of another pyrotechnic process, what is diagnostic of iron smelting and what might be bloom- or blacksmithing debris. Once I’ve identified the individual pieces, I record all the details (e.g. weight, quantity of pieces and measurements) into a spreadsheet so that I can feed in the contextual data later.Small smithing hearth bottom from BeechwoodI’m pleased to say that the assemblage from Beechwood has a bit of everything!  It’s not a large assemblage but so far I’ve identified several smithing hearth bottoms and fragments of smelting waste so that I can say that both processes were taking place on or around the site.Smelting slag from BeechwoodNow that my catalogue of the slag is complete I’ve started to look at where the pieces were recovered from. The excavations at Beechwood covered a very large area and I can see from my initial examination that the ironworking debris is focused in two quite disparate parts of the site. One area, which we’ll call A, includes a possible metalworking hearth or furnace associated with smelting slags and the other area, B, which is quite a distance away and must represent a separate focus of activity, has small residual amounts of both smelting and smithing debris. We’ve already had some of the pits and postholes from these areas radiocarbon dated and those associated with the ironworking waste have provided wonderful Iron Age dates.Looks like my task for tomorrow is to see how the Beechwood evidence fits in to other Iron Age metalworking sites in the area!For more information on our post-excavation services please check out our website:http://www.aocarchaeology.com/services/post-excavationThe Iron Age Slag – No Puns Please! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"500","Today, I am in the office mostly crunching numbers in a post excavation analysis, data basing stylie.Crunching numbers but fondly remembering my most recent fieldwork site, down by the river where, after finishing up for the day, we would spark up a BBQ and, with the smoke and scent of grilling bangers and chicken wafting through the warm evening air, we started making pots and votive figurines out of the clay freshly machined from a trench and then firing them on a bonfire.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm………Oooooohhhhh………Ta-dah!Oh happy days…BBQs and pot making don’t constitute a normal working day for professional archaeologist but demonstrate that the best advantage must always be made of any given situation.Until the next given situation: crunch, crunch, click, click, tap, tap, scribble……… The Tim Braybrooke: Senior Archaeologist Daydreams of Experimental Archaeology & BBQs by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"501","Cast of part of the Parthenon frieze at UCSIs there a typical day in the life of a Professor of Archaeological Heritage at University Campus Suffolk?This is the week of Ip-Art, the Ipswich Arts Festival. On Tuesday night I was at Arlington’s in Museum Street for a poetry evening hosted by Poetry Anglia. The building was constructed as a museum – so it appropriately became the home of the muses! I was invited to be the first reader and offered my ‘Roman Vision‘ reflecting on the Roman remains that peep out among the buildings of modern Athens.Earlier in the day I had attended an e-learning workshop. There was a focus on the use of iPads, a topic of interest to me through the Gwella project work at Swansea University (in my previous role). I am developing materials that can be delivered to smart phones and tablet devices to assist with the interpretation of archaeological and heritage sites.Wednesday was the UCS research day. There was a varied programme with a keynote address on e-medicine. I gave a paper, ‘Looting matters: cultural property, conventions and compliance’. This considered a discussion of how recently surfaced antiquities can continue to surface on the market and to be acquired by major museums. I reviewed some of the international guidelines, as well as the ethical codes for museums and dealers in ancient art. The focal point was the compliance (or non-compliance) of dealers and museums when questionable material is identified. (For more on this topic see ‘Looting Matters‘.) Earlier in the week I had received my offprint of a study of the material returned to Italy from Princeton University Art Museum.The same research conference included a discussion of project management from a colleague in the Business School. We have developed an interesting dialogue about the management of ancient projects. I was struck by the wording the (Athenian) Eleusinian Epistatai decree of the 430s BC that cites the way that the ‘management’ structure for the temple (presumably the Parthenon) and the statue (presumably the Athena Promachos) should be used as a model.The Sainsbury Centre at UEAYesterday was spent in a series of meetings at UEA in Norwich. Part of the day involved discussions in the Sainsbury Centre and it was good to see the series of Cycladic marble figures from the southern Aegean. These figures formed the subject of a research paper with Christopher Chippindale (Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology) that was published in the American Journal of Archaeology [JSTOR]. It was the first in a series of studies about cultural property.One of the trends on Twitter yesterday was the submission of online poetry from around the world to celebrate the forthcoming Olympics.  I offered my ‘Shaded Marbles‘ as an audio track with appropriate images. The theme is on (historic) cultural property currently in the British Museum. (The Greek theme was appropriate given the origins of the Games.)Another of my roles is as Head of the Division of Humanities. So this evening I will be attending the Short Story event in the Spiegeltent at Ip-Art to hear the competition winner announced. I was one of the judges for the short-listing and I have been asked to say something about our institutional support for this literary event.The From Cultural Property to Fiction by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"502","Earlier this month I had the distinct pleasure of participating in the first Linked Ancient World Data Institute (LAWDI or #lawdi on Twitter) at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) in New York City, the brainchild of Sebastian Heath, Tom Elliott, and John Muccigrosso. I presented on the current state of archaeological publishing of my organization, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA). The best part about the conference, though, was listening to new friends and colleagues speak about the many aspects of linked data, open source, and open access the archaeology of the Ancient World. As the ASCSA’s Director of Publications, I am beginning to put into practice what was discussed at LAWDI, and look forward to continuing to contribute.Here’s what’s been done so far:1. Open Access Hesperia. Our journal, Hesperia, is currently housed on JSTOR. We have a Content Sharing Agreement with JSTOR, however, which allows us to share our content from beyond the 3-year moving wall. This means that in July 2012 individual readers who need to search for and download any/all Hesperia articles published from 1932-2009 will be able to do so from the ASCSA’s website for free. The PDF articles can be read on any device that can open PDFs, and they can be used without Internet access post-download. There is no DRM. I alpha-tested the behind-the-scenes upload utility yesterday with reasonable success. I need to do a batch name-change on the PDFs and then load those onto our webserver (the test links currently point to JSTOR, but this will change in July). It is my hope that I can find just over $1M with which I can endow the journal at which point I can make open access to it complete and eternal.2. Open Bibliography on Zotero. After the LAWDI meetings, I returned to Princeton to map out what I could begin to do with the concept of linking content for the ancient world. I had briefly used Zotero to read articles posted by Tom Elliott on Twitter, but I’d never gotten into the platform as a contributor of content. Since then, I have created a Zotero group for the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in which I have now shared publicly the enter bibliography of 1,500+ Hesperia articles and about 150 (or 230+) monographs. I need to go through (and encourage others to help with this) and edit the book entries and add abstracts to earlier Hesperia articles. This will take time, but it’s a good start.3. Linking in eBooks. June saw the publication of our latest printed monograph, Isthmia: The Roman and Byzantine Graves and Human Remains (Isthmia IX), by Joseph L. Rife. I spent yesterday and will spend today creating links in the PDF eBook. My previous attempts at linking were restricted to links between text, note, table, and image. I have done this in Isthmia IX, tedium made bearable through listening to hardcore punk, gangsta rap, and the Euro 2012 match between Germany and Italy. This is only the first step. The next is to attempt to create dynamic, outward-looking links from every bibliographic citation and every footnote to actual articles and books on the Internet. This could be insane and/or impossible, but I’m going to try. I am also going to attempt to link each inventoried object as presented on the ASCSA’s open access website for archaeological data, ascsa.net. Lastly, I’m going to try to link from places mentioned in Rife’s book to records in Pleiades. Wish me luck.The above is what I’m doing now and in July, and I’m looking forward to sharing/linking with other archaeologists worldwide on these and future projects.Andrew Reinhard, Director of Publications, ASCSAThe Archaeological Publication and Linked Data by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"503","My name is Mike Middleton. I am an archaeologist, specialising in mapmaking and survey, working on two archaeological mapping projects.Out on fieldwork, getting a better view!The first is the Defining Scotland’s Places Project which aims to defining the extent of monuments in the landscape so that people know where they are, where they are and who they need to contact if they need more information. (click here to see more about this project from last years Day of Archaeology)The second project is the Historic Landuse Assessment Project, a partnership project with Historic Scotland, which aims to map the change in land use over time.It is difficult to choose just one site as my favorite. Growing up in Shetland I could have chosen Mousa, Jarlshof, Clickimin or Scatness Brochs. Living on the east coast I considered choosing the Aberlemno pictish stones, the Abernethy Round Tower or Norman’s Law hill fort but instead I have gone for a site I visited on my recent field visit, Hut Knowe. Knowe and the surrounding cord rig field systemPiers Dixon walks along a small track between fields of cord rig running in different directionsWhat is special about Hut Knowe is the amazing preservation of an entire prehistoric landscape. Not just the settlement but entire field systems. I’ve been lucky to visit many prehistoric sites over the years and, with colleagues, I’ve mapped and attempted to tease out field banks and boundaries. But, this can be frustrating with only tiny fragments surviving from which to interpret the whole.  What is so great about Hut Knowe is that the prehistoric fields of cord rig stand out so clearly. An entire c2000 year old landscape of rig, fields, trackways and settlement is there for all to see. A time capsule and one I recommend everyone to visit and certainly one for all students of Scottish landscape archaeology.The Mike Middleton RCAHMS Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"507","I was in to work early this morning.  The sun was out as I headed around the bypass to the office. As soon as the key is in the door it starts to tip down outside, so I’m glad that, whereas I’m usually in the field, today I am helping out the conservation department process a large assemblage of Roman ceramics.  The finds come from Roman fort in central Scotland, near the Antonine Wall. During the last four days I’ve been labelling pot, some of which I remember from last summer’s excavation.I will have worked for AOC in their Edinburgh office for a year this July, first as a site assistant and now as a field archaeologist.  In my first year I’ve learnt a lot: what it means to do a ‘watching brief,’ what to look for during an evaluation and the art of report writing, even picking up some experience of community archaeology along the way.Carrying on from where I left off yesterday afternoon, I’m continuing to excavate the material left inside a Roman bowl.  The bowl was lifted from ground in one piece, and was discovered in the backfill of a pit which contained other Roman material. On Roman sites, pots like this often contain human or animal remains- burials or ritual deposits, but in this case there is only the backfill of the pit, suggesting that the bowl had outlived its use and was discarded.Next there is a collection of Samian, high status pottery from Roman Gaul.  This group of sherds was discovered in a concentrated area of the site, and might make an entire vessel: time to break out the adhesive! This is a first for me and my only comparable experience is gluing a mug back together.  This is a tad more complicated.It nearly goes back together, and I don’t have any bits left over. The conservators agree it’s a success. Would they lie to protect my feelings?Finally there’s some preparation to do for a watching brief on Monday morning. My site box, spade, and personal protective equipment all need gathering together and checked before I leave for the weekend. Hope it doesn’t rain on Monday.The Friday in the Office.

"508","I am an archaeology Honours student with Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. For the last year I have been undertaking research into contemporary Indigenous graffiti in an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. I am due to submit my thesis next Monday.I am taking time out of my research to post this blog for the Day of Archaeology. Today I have been sitting at my computer, writing about some of the issues I discuss in my thesis, so I will relay them to you here.To begin, I just wanted to draw your attention to two recent events that are of significance to Australia and will soon find their place in Australian history:Australian racehorse, Black Caviar won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at the Royal Ascot; andthe Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2012 passed through the Australian Senate with bipartisan support and is now legislation.Black Caviar’s recent win is significant because with 22 races undefeated (including Royal Ascot), it is the current living racehorse with the most undefeated wins (and it’s Australian).The passing of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2012 into legislation is significant because it extends the Howard government’s controversial Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 (NTER) for a further ten years. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights condemned the NTER in 2010, claiming that it stigmatises already stigmatised communities.Have a guess which of these stories featured more prominently in the Australian media?Stronger FuturesWith little-to-no mention in Australian mainstream media, the Stronger Futures bill passed through the Senate and became legislation at 3.00am Friday 29/06/2012, after a marathon debate lasting almost ten hours. So what is wrong with it? Firstly, it is based on the NTER, which was intended to be an emergency response to the Little Children are Sacred report into Indigenous health and well being. However of the approximately 94 recommendations outlined in this report, barely two were addressed in the legislation. The recommendations in the report called for things such as improved housing, effective programs to combat alcoholism and drug use and to improve the general well being of Indigenous Australians living in these communities. The report explained that the situation in the NT, including overcrowding and alcoholism made the risk of physical and sexual child abuse very high.Instead, the federal government under then Prime Minister John Howard and then Minister for Indigenous Affairs Mal Brough, suspended the Racial Discrimination Act (later reinstated under the Rudd government) and introduced these measures in 73 Northern Territory Aboriginal communities through the NTER: Blanket bans on alcohol and pornography (pornography bans are not needed; many people don’t actually know what it is, while alcohol bans push heavy abusers outside of communities to signboard shelters, or to the homeless population in nearby urban centres);Reduction and quarantining of welfare payments;Removal of customary law and cultural practice considerations from bail applications and sentencing in criminal convictions;Removal of permit system which stopped non-Indigenous people entering Indigenous land; andabolishing the Community Development Employment Program, which gave hundreds of Indigenous people paid employment throughout the Northern Territory.One of the more invasive and offensive measures of the NTER was the erection of large blue road signs on the boundaries of each community township (pictured below).NTER Sign. These signs steal innocence from Aboriginal communities. Many children and indeed elders did not know what pornography was before these signs were erected. People living in communities bordered by these signs feel ashamed and embarrassed.• Five years after the NTER came into being, we see that it has had a negative effect on communities. There is no evidence of paedophile rings that were reported to be rampant in communities and as reported by the documentary ‘Our Generation’ in 2010, after many invasive investigations, no one has been charged. There have been reports of extreme increase in the amounts of suicide, particularly in young children and teenagers, and it has done nothing to address alcoholism. The NTER undermines Indigenous rights to self-determination, especially in terms of their own, existing political systems and income management. Supporters of the NTER urge that there are good things that have come out of this legislation, however, this is made redundant by the findings of the United Nations Human Rights Council.Indigenous Archaeology in AustraliaMy role as a student archaeologist has gone above and beyond what one would normally expect. An Aboriginal family of seven moved to Adelaide from Jawoyn country, the community in which I conduct my research, in order to obtain better access to education; you can read more about their experiences here. The youngest call me ‘Jordan-Bordan’ and love nothing more than using me as a ladder. I see this family almost everyday and I look upon them as my own family and mentors. I see the relationship I have with this family in similar ways to my biological family and I forget, sometimes, that they are not blood related. The relationship that we share is mutually beneficial as they help me navigate social and cultural taboos in Indigenous culture and I help them with the transition to a city lifestyle. Archaeology in Australia has the real potential to be incredibly ‘socially responsible’. We no longer conduct research into Indigenous cultures, we research with, for and by.Jordan Ralph and Willika family at a game of AFL.NTER and GraffitiThe focus of my research is to explore the role that governmental policy and social strategy has played in contemporary human behaviour, with a focus on contemporary graffiti in an Aboriginal community. When I first conducted fieldwork, I imagined I was going to find similar graffiti to that from a community south of Jawoyn country of which you can find photographs here and here. I did not find any graffiti that featured broad messages (inter-group messages) such as the graffiti found in the previous links. What I found instead was much more remarkable because the abundance of community messaging (intra-group messaging) indicated the strength of cultural continuity in the Northern Territory. A detailed recording and statistical analysis of contemporary graffiti in Jawoyn country shows that graffiti serves the intra-group purpose of communication between community members, rather than the inter-group purpose of propagating political and social messages. People from Jawoyn country are much more interested in communicating their connections to kinship systems and their attachments to place, in very similar ways to their ancestors. The purpose of graffiti as it is practiced in the study area is more closely related to an ongoing cultural tradition of rock-art production and landscape-marking than it is to contemporary graffiti expressions often found in urban settings. These results demonstrate the strength of cultural continuity in Jawoyn country, even after attempts have been made to ‘westernise’ Indigenous societies since colonisation through various policies, such as ‘protectionism’, ‘assimilation’, the White Australia Policy, the NTER and now Stronger Futures. ‘Wamutjan’ is a skin name from Jawoyn country, one of the groups in a complex kinship system. Graffiti is one in way which people from this community communicate membership to groups.In terms of what I have been doing today, I wrote this:I am submitting this thesis days after the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2012 was debated by the Senate. This bill passed with bipartisan support. The new legislation extends the federal government’s Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 for a further ten years. It will continue to stigmatise Indigenous cultures and undermine Indigenous rights to self-determination. For the reconciliation of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike, may basic human rights be restored in the Northern Territory and face no further intervention.

"509","I’m having a lovely lunch amongst the roses in the garden behind St Pauls church in Covent Garden. It’s a welcome break from the basement nearby where we are working, where there are two machines, a concrete cutter and a team of guys trying to install the steel framework for a new ground floor along with building the foundations for a new staircase as the building is being refurbished. The floor of the basement is being lowered as part of the refurbishment, so we’re on site excavating any surviving archaeology below the existing basement floor.We’re right in the heart of Middle Saxon London here, but most of today so far has been spent digging some 17th century pits. I’m saving up the Saxon gravel quarry pits for this afternoon! If our basement had been just a little shallower we might have had buildings and streets surviving, but all that’s left of them are fragments that have slumped into the soft fills of the pits, a tantalising glimpse of the town that stood here around 1300 years ago.The Louise Fowler: Looking for Lundenwic by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"510","The coins in the Bitterley Hoard were analysed by Dr Barrie Cook and Henry Flynn of the Department of Coins and Medals, British Museum.The summary of their report can be seen below.The hoard comprised: Edward VI, silver: 1 shilling Elizabeth I, silver: 46 shillings   James I  gold: 1 Britain crown;     silver: 4 half-crowns and 20 shillings      Charles I,  Tower mint, silver: 31 half-crowns and 33 shillings     Charles I, provincial mints, silver: 1 half-crownCharles I, Scottish coinage, silver: 1 30-shillings and 1 12-shillingsIn total there are 1 gold and 137 silver coins. The gold was of the crown gold standard, 22 carat fine, and the silver of the traditional sterling standard over 90% fine metal. The face value of the silver coins was £9 6s., including the Scottish coins in English value terms; the single gold coin was originally worth 5s. but was later re-valued to 5s.6d., giving a total for the hoard of £9 11s.6d.The latest coin is the Bristol half-crown dated 1643, produced between July 1643, when Bristol fell to Prince Rupert for the king, and March 1644. This places this group among the large number of hoards that were deposited in the early years of the English Civil War, never to be recovered until modern times.The range of coins present is entirely consistent with such a date, with the appropriate representation of Tudor and early Stuart material. Apart from the gold coin, there are only two denominations present, the half-crown and shilling, making this a batch of quite highly selected material, without even sixpences, usually the third denomination present in large numbers in mid-17th century coin hoards.The full Catalogue can be found here:http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/430201Further Reading:Anyone interested in coin hoards from this period should have a look at the excellent study by Edward Besly.E.

There are only two of us in the department so we are kept very busy and are involved in all sorts of projects with every day being completely different. We conserve and stabilise all the finds that our archaeologists in the field excavate.  Often we are the first non-archaeologists to deal with freshly excavated materials and we are constantly ensuring that the materials gain their archaeological potential.At the moment I am conserving a large number of finds from two sites excavated by our London office. The purpose of the conservation is to stabilise the finds for the long-term archive as well as possibly reveal new details on the surface of the objects, helping the specialists identify and describe the finds.  The finds are all metal – iron, lead and copper alloy with a large number of Roman coins and many coffin nails.All the artefacts were covered in thick layers of soil and corrosion obscuring the surfaces and masking any detail. Following x-raying of the finds, I cleaned the iron artefacts using an air abrasive machine and the copper alloy items using mechanical methods (scalpel, bamboo skewer) carefully under a binocular microscope.Me cleaning a copper alloy spoon under the microscope Roman coin after conservation This morning I have been finishing the last few objects and taking after treatment photographs. This afternoon I will be documenting the treatment of each object. As the objects were excavated in London we have to follow a specific documentation procedure set by the Museum of London. Each object has a A5 proforma card with specific information about the find, its condition and how it was treated.While I have been working in the lab Alan Braby a freelance illustrator has come in to do a recorded drawing of one of the amazing Roman altars that we have been conserving recently.

As I talked about last year, I work at York University as the departmental Project and Fieldwork Officer. I’m now well into my second year in this post and still very much enjoying my job. As it’s the end of term, this week has been a lot of fun, starting with the staff-student rounders match on Monday (I’m glad to report that the staff just about clinched it, despite our advancing years), continuing with the inaugural Department versus York Archaeological Trust cricket match (sadly a whitewash), and culminating in the third year results day today. Currently they are awaiting their results, but we’ll be celebrating with them later this afternoon. This has been a great year, and I’m hoping to see at least a few of them return as postgraduates next term.Amongst all this activity, I *am* actually doing some work. In between the odd student popping in for advice (it’s MA dissertation time!), I’ve been finishing off bits and pieces of work to send off to various collaborators both within and external to the department. The first of which was a fun magnetometry survey of a village destroyed during the Thirty Years War, which we carried out in the Czech Republic back in April for a project run by one of our lecturers – Jim  Symonds – and colleagues at Plzeň University.Me in one of the clearer parts of the Bohemian forest back in AprilFortunately all that needed doing was a rough interpretation to send off to the project members, and then I continued work on our major excavation project at Heslington East. All fieldwork has stopped and it is now being written up. As I’m responsible for the spatial data this involves a lot of digitisation and records checking. Most of my time is spent cursing ArcGIS, but after the inevitable crashes and lost work I’m finally getting somewhere.Today is also equipment day. I deal with the maintenance and loan of all the departmental kit, and I’ve been updating our calendars and booking in the large numbers of projects that seem to be running this summer (including my own little project with colleagues up in Scotland.

More and more I find that I do not like paper copies of articles. I much prefer digital versions that I can then edit using PDFExpert on my iPad.

Today you wonder: Who made me? Who prayed to me? Whose fears did I soothe? How many demons did I destroy? How many lives did I touch? Who broke me? And why …”These figurines provide clues to how the Ancient Egyptians coped with the vicissitudes of daily life, in many ways not so very different from ours. Now, off to another university meeting—this one on e-learning.The Databases and Materials by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"514","Chew Magna poster download (doc)Being a museum archaeologist, often means not doing archaeology but today…. I am!We’re working with Richard Sermon, the Bath & North East Somerset Council’s senior archaeological officer to prepare for our event for the Festival of British Archaeology.Each summer we leave the hot busy city and descend on a community to run an event highlighting the archaeology and history of the area.  This year we’re heading out to Chew Magna, a lovely rural village with Medieval origins, in Bath & North East Somerset.  Even the venue we’ll be in (the Old School Room) has an amazing Medieval hammer-beam roof.So we’re getting out objects from the collection that have been excavated from the village to show and explain to visitors on the day.  Even small bits of pottery have a story to tell and we always share the secrets of how to date them (if it’s green-glazed it’s a fair bet its Medieval).Archaeology is not just about digging and so a lot of our information and activities this year will be looking at what we call standing buildings (if they weren’t standing surely they’d be called ruins wouldn’t they?).  To save themselves money house-owners often rebuilt and modernised just the fronts of their houses, but behind the posh Georgian or swanky Victorian exterior there’s often a much earlier house lurking.And by looking at old maps you can see the growth of a village even if its not documented. Chew Magna’s in the Domesday Book so that’s another bit of information we are using.The event is on Saturday 14th July so there’s still time, to print the handout, write information for the displays, pack the objects, photocopy the trail…Hope to see you there!Susan FoxCollections Manager, Roman Baths Museum, BathThe Preparing for an public event at Chew Magna by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"515","Here are the results from our registered finds shelf lotteryShelf seven (suggested by Pat Hadley – thanks Pat) of our Registered finds section of the Archive is the start of a sequence of finds that were excavated before professional archaeology became existed inLondon, during the very early 1970s. At this time theMuseumofLondon’s forbearer – the Guildhall Museum– was undertaking excavations across the city. This object – a classic Roman oil lamp – was excavated on Gracechurch street in 1969.Roman Lamp from GM69 site – and shelf number 7This Roman lamp is known as a picture lamp, as the central ‘discus’ is decorated. It may be a Loeschecke (1919) Type IV, although difficult to tell as types are usually distinguished by the nozzle, which in this case is broken. It probably dates to the C1st AD and in particular the Boudican revolt as it was discovered in association with a major burnt strata with other C1st pottery.A very similar lamp has also been discovered on a recent Archive volunteer project – VIP9 – although not in such a good state of preservation! Closer comparison may reveal if it was made from the same two-piece mould, as these objects were mass produced.Shelf 342 (tweeted by our very own Adam Corsini while on holiday in Sardinia) of our Registered finds stores material from the 1980s, a point in time when archaeology withinLondonhad become highly professionalised – having a major impact on how we eventually archive material and records from excavation.Our second lucky winner(s) are  fragmentary pieces of medieval window glass. Excavated on the site of the Royal Mint in 1986, this glass may have formed part of the medieval Abbey or Chapter House. By the C16th window glass such as this would have been found more commonly in secular buildings as opposed to religious buildings. Although extremely aesthetic, the array of colours this glass has produced are not intentional – this is actually the glass decomposing, or delaminating, as a result of being buried in the ground for hundreds of years.Fragments of medieval stained glass from MIN86, and shelf 342Next it’s our Metal artefacts – these objects are stored separately. A dehumidified store, sealed boxes and silica gel help us maintain these objects to a high degree of preservation as they’d slowly degrade in normal room conditions.

"519","  Contemporary Value of the HoardJonathon Worton, a research student at the University of Chester has suggested what the hoard could have been worth in the 17th Century. This is really interesting as it puts some perspective into how far money went in the period. From my point of view as an archaeologist it just proves the old adage  “The only things certain in life are death and taxes“.Jonathon writes:“with reference to monetary values, I always think it is more informative to consider the contemporary purchasing power, rather than attempting modern equivalence.Some interesting examples:1. In 1640/41 the day rate paid by the Corporation of Shrewsbury for ‘public works’ for an artificer – a wheelwright, carpenter, joiner – was 14d (less if ‘diet’ – food – included), 8d for a day labourer. These were probably good average rates for a days’ toil. (Ref. Reed, Shropshire Transactions, Vol LV).2. In 1636/7, at Tong, a local carpenter was paid over £8 for his work in refurbishing the church (Ref. Tong Churchwardens’ Accounts); at the above rates, this may have represented some 140 days’ wages (fewer if he were master craftsman, or if his mates were paid out of this).3. In the 1630s the fee to become a burgess in Shrewsbury was £5.So by these values, the hoard does not represent unexceptional wealth – perhaps the ready monies/savings of a reasonably competent tradesman, or a yeoman farmer.Other comparables are suggested by the annual Ship Money levies of the latter 1630s – perhaps the first attempt at a near universal national tax.From Ludlow the gent. William Bowdler assessed, as one of the town’s highest payers, for £2 in 1635, and 36s – £1 16s – in 1640; also from 1640 we have ‘Mr’ William Colbatch, assessed for 10s, and the gent. Adam Acton at 12s.These sums were assessed to pay the total annual shire levy of £4,500. To put this in wartime context, in 1643 the Royalists were attempting to raise £4,500 per month from the county by the ‘Contribution tax’; Although they doubtless never accomplished this, regular monthly or bi-montly payments of individuals of £1 16s, or 12s would have been a cumulative burden. This would have been in addition to other regular and irregular impositions – payments for the militia, fortifications etc.The Contribution tax certainly depended on the assessment of the cumulative wealth of a local community, but individuals were assessed according to land holding – the obvious measure – but also in goods and monies. So, it may have been wise to conceal one’s petty cash, as the military were perennially short of it! Although of course it deposited by a civilian, why the family did not collect it in happier times is a mystery (unless he/she wanted to keep the family silver in absolute secrecy).If the hoard was deposited by soldier – an officer – even with the vagaries of civil war military salaries, it would not have been difficult to accumulate such a fundA good comparable to the hoard’s relative value might be that of horses – a valued possession at all levels of early Stuart society. Rates for good cavalry mounts, purchased in London and the southeast in 1644 for the Parliamentarian army of Sir Thomas Myddleton, which served in and around Shropshire, varied between £5 and £7 per animal. For a couple of geldings for his own use (although these must have been real thoroughbreds) Sir Thomas paid £35 5s.

"520","One of the delights of specialist post-ex work is that you never know quite what the next delivery from the postman or courier will bring. Today’s delivery was of 15 crates of iron-working residue (almost quarter of a tonne!) from a medieval site in Ireland.A quick look (its a bit like Christmas…!) shows a beautifully-preserved assemblage of slag and large fragments of tuyères (the ceramic ‘nozzle’ carrying the blast from the bellows into the blacksmith’s hearth).Reporting on an assemblage like this is not simply a job of putting labels on items, rather its a process of real research. None of the processes and techniques which produced these residues is fully understood. Each assemblage adds a small piece to the big picture of the development of metalworking, not just to the understanding of the individual site and its economic context.However, curiosity has to be curbed, for now. This collection joins the queue of material to be studied in coming weeks; today’s tasks are very different. They belong to the other end of the investigation process: the interpretation and reporting on detailed analytical data – but more of that later…  The What is in the Post? by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"521","I am Georgina Brown, a surveyor and cartographer in the Landscape Section at RCAHMS. The site that I have chosen is the archaeological landscape around Inveresk. At this point, I had better admit to a slight bias in choosing this site as Musselburgh is my adopted home town. Very little of the archaeology in this area is actually visible on the ground; most is buried below the modern day land surface and has only been revealed when an excavation has taken place or when it shows up as a cropmark in the fields; however, when you put all the discoveries together, they tell a fascinating story.Roman remains were first noted at Inveresk in the 1560s but the story of the fort and its environs is still being added to today. Parts of the Roman Fort were excavated in the 1940s and many other structures and artefacts have since been discovered around Inveresk during excavations preceding building work. The remains of houses, streets and wells of the civilian vicus were unearthed at Inveresk Gate, the base of a possible viewing stand for a Roman parade ground was discovered at Lewisvale Park and, close by, altar stones to Mithras and Sol were found during the construction of the cricket pavilion. Most recently, Roman and Iron Age skeletons along with the remains of an enclosure, possibly used for storing military supplies shipped in from the continent, were found at the former Brunton’s Wireworks site. The area’s outlying features – Roman temporary camps and field systems – have been revealed as cropmarks on aerial photographs. Add to this list Mesolithic flints, a 900m long Neolithic cursus, Bronze Age burials, Iron Age house remains and you have a very rich and varied “invisible” archaeological landscape.Map of Roman Remains at InvereskInveresk Cropmark remainsTo have a look at these sites and a map showing where they all lie, try the following links.Inverest FortRoman temporary campsWestfield CursusAltars to Mithras and SolSkeletons at the former Brunton’s Wireworks site The Georgina Brown RCAHMS Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

So, despite the dreary weather, we’re all in festive mood here. The Volvo Round the World Yacht Race is due to finish in the harbour over the weekend, the Galway Arts Festival follows the week of festivities around the Yacht Race and the famous Galway Races follow that. Then, in early August we’re hosting our small boutique ‘Archaeology of Beer’ Festival in Headford, Co. Galway (Headfest). It’s been described as Ireland most boutique, boutique festival. This year, due to a lack of funding, we’ve downsized the gig, so it’ll be even more boutique!This morning I’ve been focused on beer. I’ve been researching ancient recipes and brewing methods for a ‘wild’ beer. A wild beer is a beer which is fermented using windblown or other wild yeasts, and is something we’ve never really tried before. It could (and probably will) turn out awful… We’ve brewed two beers so far. One, a bog myrtle (Myrica Gale) and malt ale with some yarrow flavouring (Gale Ale), the second a simple hopped ale (so that people can taste the difference between a modern hopped ale and an ancient non-hopped herbal ‘gruit’ ale). We’ve already tasted our ‘Gale Ale’ and, it’s really nice, if I say so myself…. We had separated it into three batches – one is a ‘lighter’ ale of about 6% ABV, the second is stronger and is around 8% ABV and the third is a really strong 9.5% ABV ale. We’ve one more beer to brew and I’m trying to work out a recipe for next weeks brewday. On Headfest day we’ll be demonstrating our brewing in a replica fulacht fiadh using hot rocks to get our liquor to the right temperature. You can read more about our hot rock experiments on our blog…Unfortunately beer doesn’t pay the bills so we have other more mundane duties to perform today as well. I’m currently completing a constraints study on a large electricity infrastructure project. Essentially this entailed mapping and describing the existing, known, cultural heritage of the study area, using existing data sources and information. We’ve mapped all these data and today I have to review the mapping to ensure that it’s correct. It sounds dull, but there are some interesting diversions. For instance, comparing the first edition OS Maps with the second editions gives a picture of a remarkably changed landscape which mirrors the economic history of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Ireland. Despite the intervening famine there was huge development in the West of Ireland, with the construction of roads, railway lines, bridges and the introduction, and eventual dissipation, of large demesnes and designed landscapes. Whereas the early maps (surveyed in the 1830s and 1840s) depict remote clusters of houses and small landholdings in many cases reachable only by tracks, by the 1890’s or early 1900’s these remote locations are served by roads and other services.   Much of this growth in the latter part of the 19th century is down to the Napoleonic Wars when Ireland experienced a huge surge in economic circumstances (an early Celtic Tiger period) and the passing of the Land Acts in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century which eventually dissipated the power of the Anglo-Irish landed gentry and created a large sector of small landowners throughout the country.My colleague Billy, meanwhile, is busy preparing finds for deposition in the National Museum, cataloguing and boxing… He’s currently looking at shoes.A shoe from post medieval GalwayThe shoe pieces (44 in all) were retrieved from the Market House excavation (for more on the excavation see here) during the course of the Eyre Square Re-enhancement Project in the middle of Galway City in 2004. Most of the fragments were retrieved from a rectangular test pit excavated across the centre of the site representing successive metalled surfaces and dump deposits pre-dating an 18th century building at the north end of Eyre Square. The majority of the pieces come from post-medieval contexts consisting largely of footwear fragments and off cuts. Shoes are fascinating (I’m serious)… Here’s an excerpt from Billy’s report:“The shoe styles found share similar characteristics with comparative urban excavations in Cork and Waterford and more locally from Barrack lane, Galway. The most common shoe type of the medieval period was the turnshoe, made as the name suggests by stitching a wet and inside out leather upper to a sole and then turning it rightside out so that the sewing is protected. The upper would then be wrapped around the foot and secured by either a strap, latched or using a thong. This simple template evolved through time for utilitarian purposes or simply as fashion dictated. Heels were initially made by sewing stiffeners inside the shoe to prevent wearing.From the sixteenth century onwards heels developed into a series of separate “lifts” (“built heel”) stacked and pinned or sewed together. Similarly the upper changed from a simple wraparound piece to an overshoe consisting of a ‘vamp’ or toe covering, quarters covering the inner and outer sides of the foot, the tongue, a piece of leather to the front placed between two sides of a tied opening and the back strap. Another common shoe feature was a welt (sometimes called rand) or strip of leather stitched along the lasting margin between the upper and the sole to protect the seam and make the shoe watertight. Common shoes of the second half of the eighteenth century were the heavy brogue and the knee length boot. The native brogue (after the Irish bróga, meaning shoe) was a low heeled, heavy shoe of un-tanned leather with laces along the instep and no tongue with small perforations on the toe puff and quarters. This hardwearing footwear was practically designed for country men as a shoe that would drain water and dry quickly due to the lack of a tongue, and not get stuck in the mud because of their laces above the ankle. Knee length boots were an English introduction and were more expensive and associated with the landed gentry, given the restrictive laws for horse ownership during the penal law era.Concerning leather as a raw material, cow hide was generally used in the manufacture of most shoe soles, welts and binds – it being the strongest and most resilient of the available skins. For the uppers, calf, goat or sheep skin were the preferred choices for reasons of flexibility and comfort.”See – I told you, Shoes are fascinating!As archaeologists it’s the ordinary things we find which inform our discourse with the past and which give me most satisfaction. The big finds and the big sites are, of course, part of the process, but it’s the archaeology of the ordinary that keeps me interested – the shoes, the nails, the bottles and pot sherds, all of which tell us a story and fill in the gaps in our knowledge.The Festivals, Shoes, Maps and Beer in Galway, Ireland by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

We are a joint team from Cardiff University UK, Stony Brook, US and Poznan, Poland looking at the faunal remains to understand the human:animal relationship at the site. This week we began the season by examining the bones from building 80 (late in the site but still about 7-8000 years ago). So far we have recorded domestic sheep and dogs, wild aurochs, boar, deer and horses as well as tortoise, stork and jackal. We have a worked aurochs scapula, maybe used as a shovel, a possible bone ‘flute’ and bone gouges.Excavation is focusing on removing backfill from the previous years ready to start excavation in ernest next week. The focus this year is on a number of houses, some of which have already produced cattle horncore installations, wall paintings and human burials beneath the floors.Hand prints from Building 77. Two of a long series of handprints. Photo by Ashley Lingle, Catalhoyuk Research Project The team is building with 60ish of us so far, and increasing to about 150 by the end of next week.  There are labs for human and animal bones, pots, stones, plants, conservation and finds as well as two separate excavation areas.  It is hard to keep track of everyone, so we have posted our photos and names on our lab door so folk can ID us. The excavation is truly international with folk from Sweden, Poland, US, Canada, Turkey, Greece and of course Wales.Our first day off is being spent at the lovely Dedeman Hotel by the pool using their internet (thanks!). There is extremely restricted internet access at the site.  A highlight this week was the Tarkan concert – a Turkish singing sensation who performed to about 20k people in a mall carpark.We are looking forward to the rest of the seasons excavations – and working with all the different specialists on-site.   Rather than material being analysed months, or years after it is dug up, in different labs around the world we are all here together.    Roll on the excavations – well, after just one more dip in the pool….. The A day off – Faunal Team Catalhoyuk 2012 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"525","I’ve been a commercial archaeologist for 13 years and have worked in Ireland, Greece and Australia. My days once consisted of jumping into a muddy hole in the depths of winter to shovel out the sticky and waterlogged fills within and then trudge to the spoil-heap with heavy boots. My days also consisted of excavating beautiful wooden troughs in fulachta fiadh (burnt mounds) or excavating postholes of Bronze Age structures in the balmy summer sun. However, the recession in Ireland has led to a decline in commercial archaeological work and the absence of muddy viz-vest clad hordes of trowel-grasping excavators is the most visible proof of this!Although I miss those days and would drop my pen for a trowel at the drop of a hard-hat, I decided to specialise in environmental archaeology. My dissertation was based upon a seed assemblage from Syria (http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~nmiller0/syria.html), which I never had the chance to visit before the war broke out. The study entailed hours of back-breaking and eye-straining microscope work, but it was worth it in the end!  The seed assemblage from this amazing site (http://www.unipa.it/falsone/en/introduction.html) has added to the knowledge we have already of Bronze Age economics in this part of the world. Highly structured societies saw economic collapse and regeneration similar to the worldwide recession (sssh don’t mention the war!) that we are currently experiencing. These stages can be identified through a multi-disciplinary approach to the excavation and research and seeds play an important role in this approach. For example, the appearance of nutritionally demanding cash-crops, such as wine and figs, and the greater role played by stored grain in the tells and towns for trade and export, indicate how well-structured or wealthy a tell was.  The analysis of the rest of the assemblage to augment this picture is one of my day jobs!I also work with material from home (http://www.ipean.ie/profile_Nikolah.html) and recent and interesting jobs include assemblages from medieval Kilkenny (Cill Chainnigh), a city located to the southwest of Dublin. This was an important settlement in the early medieval period and the recent discovery of the earliest identified grape (11th/12th century) in Ireland from the Robing Room in Bishop’s Palace (http://www.kkap.ie/assets/bishops-palace-plant-remains.pdf) highlighted the status of Cill Chainnigh  in this period.  The analysis of assemblages from sites around Ireland is another on of my day jobs!Occasionally, I get to throw on my steel-toe-capped boots and visit a site where works are taking place. More often than not, as is typical for an archaeologist, most of the days which consist of office work are warm and pleasant and the sun’s rays taunt through the window, while those days on-site are spent standing in the rain watching track machines and bulldozers! But, I’m fairly certain that there are no archaeologists out there who say they don’t love their job.

"527","This year’s “Day of Archaeology” finds me attempting to reorder my life just following the 2012 Arkansas Archeological Society Summer Training Program.The Arkansas Archeological Society (AAS) was formed in 1960. It is open to anyone—from any walk of life—who is interested in archaeology.  This year I dug alongside retired school teachers, firemen, administrative assistants, college students, engineers, electricians, high school students, retired mill workers, social workers, research foresters, park interpreters (and park superintendents)  and college English instructors.  Many of these so-called avocationals have been doing archaeology for more years than me (some longer than I’ve been alive).  Two of our long time volunteers this year were 86 years old.  Anna Parks has been coming to the AAS

learn about archaeology.The 1836 Hempstead County Courthouse is ever present during our work at Historic Washington State Park in Arkansas.Way back in 1964, a series of weekend excavations began under the direction of University of Arkansas Museum archaeologists and AAS members.  In the late 1960s the AAS was instrumental in lobbying my organization—the Arkansas Archeological Survey—into existence.  Thus the Survey and Society began partnering on digs by 1967.  By 1972, what had begun as a series of weekend events had expanded into a 16-day training program with excavations at various sites across the state.  Some have claimed that it’s the oldest and best program of its type in the country.For the second year in a row I had the honor of directing the AAS Summer Dig at Historic Washington State Park in the southwestern portion of the state of Arkansas in the southern United States.  Between June 9 and June 24, 2012 over 100 volunteers and staff helped me investigate the site of an 1830s commercial district on what would have then been the edge of western expansion of the United States (Washington was a border town with first Mexico and then the Republic of Texas until Texas was annexed in the late 1840s).The AAS has been doing archaeology in Historic Washington State Park since 1980, but these last two years have focused on the merchant district for which we have very few historical documents.  There are no known photographs and only a single map from 1926—long after fires in the 1870s and 1880s put an end to this vibrant business area.  Over the last two field seasons we have recovered the remains of at least 6 different buildings,  4-6 cellars and/or trash pits and tens of thousands of artifacts that will help us tell the story of this once important regional hub on the edge of the “cotton frontier.”The archaeology was great, but I am always amazed at the layers of public archaeology going on at these events.  On one level we are teachingthe volunteers how to be archaeologists—not only through digging but also through a series of half-day seminars taught in two sessions throughout the dig.  This year we offered Basic Excavation (for first time attendees), Basic Laboratory Procedures, Site Survey, Mapping, Human Osteology, Indians of Arkansas, and Establishing Time (a class that helps volunteers understand dating techniques used by archaeologists).On a second level of public archaeology, the volunteers and professionals on site then educate the general public about the value and methods of archaeology.  As we were excavating in an Arkansas State Park this year this was done constantly as we has many curious visitors every day.  Although I was “running the show” I rarely had to stop my work to help explain things to visitors as one of my colleagues and/or volunteers would quickly rush in to take over (and even demonstrate) what we were doing.Of course, although the dig ended on June 24, there is still much to do.  In these days following the 2012 Summer Training Program I (and Carl Carlson-Drexler, my Research Station Assistant) have been moving equipment, organizing paperwork and field notes…Today I’m captioning the hundreds of digital photographs taken during the dig.  The two years of digging in the merchant district in Historic Washington State Park has produced more than twice the amount of artifacts than I recovered during my dissertation research (and I poked at that site for almost a decade!)…so I now have my work cut out for me…More pictures from the 2012 AAS Summer Training Program can be found

"528","Great, that’s the eight Roman coins done. No exciting ones I’m afraid. Maybe I should do the artifacts next and save that large silver coin of Charles I as a treat for later. Standard FLO kit for recording: digital calipers, accurate but portable scales, magnifying lens, bags and pens for labeling and the essential books for references.A nice interruption over coffee when the museum curators show off their latest acquisition, bought at auction yesterday. It is a bell from the house at Chapel Cleeve (the contents of the house were dispersed at auctions in the 1980s). It was cast in the 19th century by the founders Cox’s of Taunton who were based at Tancred street in Taunton and also made skillets (some are on display at the Museum of Somerset). They were not specialist   so didn’t (as far as we know) cast church bells. This is the sort of bell that would have been used to call the estate and house workers in for meals and let them know the time so it does not need to ring to a particular note.

"529","Not even being the Day of Archaeology 2012 could bring the sunshine to Edinburgh today, so whilst the view from the office at the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (SoAS), is definitely dreich, at least reading about all this archaeology will brighten up the day!My name is Emma Jane O’Riordan and I am the Project Assistant for the Scottish Archaeological Research Framework (ScARF) or @scarfhub on Twitter. The project took part in the Day of Archaeology last year too so you can read about the background to the project in the 2011 posts from the Project Manager, Jeff Sanders here and here.Ideas for ScARF postcardsIdeas for ScARF postcardsThe first task of the day is some Friday fun – I have to design some postcards to promote the project. There are nine panels in ScARF, seven of these are period based (Paleolithic and Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Medieval and Modern) but there is also a Marine and Maritime panel and finally a Science panel.Deciding on one image to define each report is therefore quite tricky – how do you define ‘science’ in archaeology through one image? Therefore, I’ve decided to use word clouds instead. These are only ideas after all!The ScARF wiki at www.scottishheritagehub.comNow that I’ve had the first cup of tea of the day and finished playing about with images, its time to knuckle down and finish off some tasks that have been on the desk for a while. Usually, I make a do list at the end of each day for the next, but since my boss is on holiday for the next few days my to do list covers a whole week and so looks a lot scarier than it is!First up is writing some guides to using the ScARF wiki (for those more technical minded folk, the ScARF wiki uses Drupal). Jeff wrote last year for #dayofarch that“we are developing a ‘wiki’  in order to house the information from the reports, as well as all of the extra information that we had to edit down. Hopefully, we can keep this updated and streamlined so that it becomes a useful and used resource (not much worse than a dead wiki!)”.It is really only in the last few months that we have realised how much more useful than the pdf reports the wiki could be. Perhaps the most useful thing is that registered users can leave comments on pages, which we hope will spark some lively debate. So far, ‘hot’ topics include Medieval coins and Norse Scotland, people have identified gaps and some have even offered to write text to fill these gaps in, which is very kind.In fact, all of the content in ScARF – around 800,000 words of main text, by around 320 contributors – has been given in kind. I think this is a monumental achievement by the sector and shows the love people working in all areas of Archaeology have for the subject! Today I’ve got to finish up the guides on how to register, how to leave comments and a more comprehensive one on reading the wiki as a whole. Guides can be boring though, so I’m hoping lots of nice annotated screenshots will do the trick. In the future, we might make a video guide to using the wiki but I’d rather find a victim willing volunteer for that other than me!Now its time for lunch – today I’ll be spending it with Natasha Ferguson from the Treasure Trove. We did Archaeology at university together and although this won’t be a working lunch I’m sure we’ll chat about some of the other exciting Day of Archaeology posts!The Friday fun in the ScARF office – part 1 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"530","Well, hello from a soggy south-west Scotland. I’m Giles, Development Officer for Discovering Dumfries and Galloway’s Past and I wanted to tell you on Day of Archaeology 2012 about the project and what we are going to be doing over the next week or so…DDGP is an exciting new community archaeology project based in south-west, providing training in using geophysical survey to help volunteers record, understand and interpret the region’s fascinating archaeology. There’s going to be plenty of opportunity for local people right across the region to get involved in the surveys – it’s a great way to find out more about buried archaeology without having to excavate.What is geophysics, and what can we find out using it?Not all archaeology is about excavation – you may have come across ‘geofizz’ on TV’s Time Team where it’s often used to plan where to put the trenches in. Geophysics is a way of mapping buried archaeological deposits – be they ditches, pits or building material – without ever breaking the ground surface.There are two main techniques for geophysical survey:Glasgow University archaeologists undertaking resistivity surveyResistivity: By passing a small electrical current into the ground, and measuring the amount of resistance that results, it is possible to locate buried remains of archaeological interest.Resistance is related to the amount of moisture in the soil. Around buried walls, for example, the surrounding soil will often be dryer. The current cannot pass so easily through this dry soil, so stonework can often show up as areas of higher resistance. This technique is therefore ideal for locating building walls and foundations.Glasgow University archaeologists undertaking magnetic surveyMagnetometry:  This technique detects extremely small variations in the earth’s magnetic field, caused when the ground has been disturbed by previous activity. Burning, for instance, will often leave a significant magnetic trace.Magnetometry is excellent for locating ditches, pits, middens, hearths and kilns – and is great at covering large areas quite quickly.The great thing about geophysical survey is that the results can be rapidly downloaded on site to a laptop, and even with minimum processing it is possible to define ‘anomalies’ which can represent buried archaeology. For volunteers on the project surveys this is great – they can see the fruits of their labours in the field. We are aiming to get these very quickly into reports which will be uploaded onto our website, to share them with as wide an audience as possible.Our next surveyIt’s all a bit hectic in the office today as we put the finishing touches to our programme for next week’s survey. We’ll be undertaken both magnetic and resistivity survey at the nationally important site of the Roman fort at Birrens. This continues work that the University of Glasgow have been concentrating on – looking in and around Roman military sites in Eastern Dumfriesshire.Magnetic survey results around Bankhead Roman fort, DalswintonThis has looked at fabulous sites around Lockerbie, such as the Roman fort at Dalswinton. As you can see this has added loads of detail (as you can see on the right) to both the inside of the fort of Bankhead and the surrounding area – which aerial photographs have shown to be really interesting.At Birrens Roman fort, near Middlebie, we’ll be focusing on similar things. A group of 6 volunteers will be joining us for 3 days next week to carry out some resistivity survey on the interior – hopefully we’ll get detail of the street pattern, as well as an idea of how the buildings – both the barrack blocks and administrative headquarters of the fort – were laid out.You can find out more about Birrens fort – known to the Romans as blatobulgium (literally the ‘flour sack’) here.We’re having an Open Day on Saturday July 7th – it’ll be a great chance to show the public the results as well as an opportunity to show just how geophysics ‘works’ – including the amount of walking in straight lines that’s involved! The response has been fantastic locally – so here’s hoping for some sunshine!I hope this has wet your apetite both for ‘geophysics’ and the project – please see our website to keep up to date with the latest – discoveringdgpast.wordpress.com.The project is jointly funded by the Scottish Government and The European Community, Dumfries and Galloway Leader 2007-2013; The Crichton Foundation and The University of Glasgow.The Discovering Dumfries and Galloway’s Past by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"531","8am. I found myself on a building site, in a dank basement peering down a 2m deep hole, wielding both a torch and a hand tape as I valiantly attempted to record a late medieval barrel-lined well and a medieval quarry pit that were visible in section. This was challenging to say the least as  I wasn’t about to enter a deep, unshored foundation trench – safety first! In addition to my usual hard hat, safety boots and gloves, I was also wearing ear defenders and a dust mask, as they were breaking out concrete nearby; all you could see of my face were my eyes. A few snaps for the archaeological record later and I could be found slowly sinking into the spoil heap waving a metal detector around, listening for the beep that would indicate a potentially exciting small find. Unfortunately, all I seemed to detect today were the iron girders supporting the existing building. I did my best to wipe off the mud caking my steel-toe capped boots, but still felt guilty once I had climbed out of the basement and seen that the site cleaner had just finished vacuuming the construction site office.Hazards of archaeology #725: muddy boots; Hazards of archaeology #726 leaving muddy bootprintsI left site at 9.30am and caught a bus to the office. I’ve never managed to travel light as an archaeologist, but today I felt like a packhorse as I carted: my rucksack, the site records, camera, half-metre scale and metal detector to the bus stop. If you were walking through the City of London this morning and were almost taken out by an over-laden, slightly disheveled individual with hard-hat hair wearing a grubby pair of jeans – I can only apologise.Present time. After a cup of tea and a catch-up (ok, ok – gossip) with my colleagues, I’ve settled down to write this post before starting work on a geotechnical watching brief report for a site I finished a few weeks ago. As thrilling as that sounds, I may need some chocolate biscuits for motivation.

"532","I have been the Finds Liaison Officer for Northamptonshire since October 2008, and trying to give an account of what it is like to be an FLO, and the challenges, joys and bizarre incidents I have encountered over the last (almost) 4years in a one day diary post is impossible.I am hosted in Northants County Council by the Archive and Heritage Service. This team includes the HER (Historic Environment Record) and the Record Office, who are generally archivists, and so although I am part of a team which curates and maintains the Historic resources of the county, I am very much alone in what I do. I handle, research and record archaeological artefacts discovered by members of the public. Being the only FLO in what is a relatively small county in the Midlands (when compared to my colleagues in Kent, Essex and the North) has its challenges and rewards like any other job.Despite meaning to engineer my diary so that I had something interesting to report on for today, my diary is actually relatively quiet compared to other days where I do Finds Surgeries in museums and Council Offices across the county. Finds Surgeries allow  members of the public to meet me and bring me artefacts they have discovered, and want me to identify and record for them. 90% of these surgeries are used by metal detectorists, who deliberately search fields with the intention of discovering archaeological artefacts. The majority of whom do their own research and have a good understanding of what they have found, bringing them to me for the purposes of recording them for archaeological knowledge and research, rather than for ID alone.  But of that remaining 10% I am often delighted by the range of artefacts discovered accidentally by people digging their garden, or walking across the countryside, and who are genuinely amazed by what they have found. A case in point is PAS database record NARC-894AF2, found by a young lady when digging a rockery in her back garden and whose father very sheepishly brought it in to me at a Finds Surgery in Daventry, hoping he wasn’t embarrassing himself by bringing me a rock! In fact what he had brought me was a genuine Acheulian hand axe, dating to the Lower paeleolithic era and adding to our scant knowledge of Palaeolithic Northants. Yes, that was in 2009, so maybe I am cheating by mentioning it here – but it gives you the perfect case in point – you never know what is coming through the door in this job!In an age when few museums have archaeological curators on staff to advise people on their finds, the FLO in most counties tend to be the first port of call for people with questions about archaeological artefacts and treasure. These questions range from wondering about a date and meaning of Willow pattern pottery in their back garden, to showing me flints found in the garden, driveway or field wondering if they are worked and of importance (very rarely the case, but it isn’t impossible and I’d always rather people double checked than didn’t try at all!), to large collections of metal detected artefacts from people who have detected for a long period of time and want to record them with the PAS. In between those categories are the metal detectorists who visit me every month to record their previous months finds, and we have a regular turn over of artefacts.This type of collection is one which I am working my way through now. It has a range of pottery, Roman coins, medieval pennies and some post-medieval finds which I will not record but will offer the finder an ID for them by writing on the bag (“Georian fob” and the like). Each object is in a bag with the findspot location written on it, which is ideal. This collection is a accurate representation of the general finds from most fields. People get very excited over Treasure cases, and the discovery of a treasure case is sometimes the only press metal detecting and PAS gets. The reality is much less headline grabbing, but much more archaeologically significant.After I have battled my way through that small collection, I have these large boxes of pottery to wade through from a field walker in Geddington which will probably, for the sake of time and my sanity, end up as a bulk report for the HER rather than an individual record for each sherd on the PAS database.Fieldwalkers pottery collection After that, I have approximately 25 emails to reply to, mostly from people wanting to know where to meet me so I can see their objects, or wanting to know how I am getting on with their objects and when can they have them back (I try for a 2 month turn around, but the more finds that come in, the harder this self-imposed deadline gets).Then will be preparation for Monday’s Finds Research Group (FRG) meeting. I was asked to be on the FRG committee as a representative of the Post-Medieval period by the late, great Geoff Egan,who is still sorely missed. Post-Med to modern finds are often disregarded by archaeologists, and by my work with the FRG and Post-Med Arch I am trying to increase the realisation among the archaeological community that they are a valuable resource which will be lost to future generations if we don’t stop disregarding them now. I hope I can do Geoff proud on this! It would be remiss of me to mention what I do in a day without mentioning the time I spend on Twitter, which in some jobs would be labelled as time wasting! But as an archaeologist -  in addition to finding out all about what Stephen Fry and John Prescott are up to on a daily basis during my coffee breaks – I have found it a massively valuable resource in finding out about research projects and exhibitions which I would have no idea about otherwise.  Social media is here to stay and should be used as a resource by everyone to communicate events and ideas. And judging by the really interesting post already up there from #dayofarch, many people are coming around to that. The A FLO’s Life by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"533","I am a student of archaeology, fitting study around a fulltime job. As such, I tend to weave archaeology into my daily life, and today is no exception.As per every other day of the week, breakfast is eaten over an archaeological text of some sort – today it is an A-Z “Dictionary of Egyptology”. I am covering up the description of each entry and testing my knowledge as I go. Anything that is new to me I jot down in my notebook of “Things to Learn.”After a morning at work, it is lunchtime and I pull out the latest copy of “Archaeological Diggings” magazine. I skip straight to the news section to see if there are any stories I’ve not yet heard about.An afternoon of work, home for dinner, and then time spent as per every evening trawling the web for the latest archaeological news for my “World Archaeology News” blog. I begin work on my next weekly post of top headlines.Then finally time to curl up on the couch with Boyo Ockinga’s “A Concise Grammar of Middle Egyptian” and spend the rest of the evening continuing the study of hieroglyphs.Soon I will be off to bed, no doubt to dream of ancient civilisations . . .Passionate?

"534","Today I have been doing environmental monitoring of archaeological collections on display at the new SeaCity Museum (opened in April this year). I was lucky enough to start a new job last week as Collections Care and Access Trainee for Southampton City Council Museum Collection Management, funded by the Heritage Lottery Skills for the Future scheme. So far I have had some fantastic opportunities to learn about collections and documentation and today we are focused on environmental monitoring to ensure the objects’ conditions are stable.Tiny Tag in the Millbrook Roman Hoard display caseThe museum houses a range of objects related to Southampton’s past which includes this fantastic hoard of Roman coins excavated in Millbrook, Southampton. Over 4,000 late 3rd century Roman coins were found during building work. 1,000 of these coins have been put on display for the public to view at SeaCity Museum. The coins are copper alloy and need to be monitored to preserve them in as good a state as possible. To achieve this Tiny Tags were put in cases with vulnerable objects to record temperature and humidity readings at regular intervals on a daily basis.Next job is to download the information to create graphs and interpret if the levels are right for that particular case. These Tiny Tags can record and store data for three months so the data is logged and the Tiny Tags reset at a minimum of every three months.Another display case for monitoring is the settlement in Hamwic case. This consists of loom weights, a cooking pot, lamp, spindle whorl, linen smoother, bone comb, whistle, ice skate and tweezers. It is important to monitor this case to keep the bone and metal in the appropriate conditions to prevent the objects from deteriorating.Putting a Tiny Tag into the Hamwic display caseHamwic was a Middle Saxon (c.700-850) town situated around what is now Northam and St Marys in modern Southampton. It was an important port and excavations show that many crafts and industries were practiced in Hamwic. The excavations at Hamwic have resulted in one of the best collections of Middle Saxon finds in Europe so I feel privileged to work so closely with such exciting finds!I have a background in archaeology with a BA in History and Archaeology and a Masters in Maritime Archaeology so it has been a very interesting day learning about monitoring conditions for objects post excavation and the dimensions and concerns about displaying objects, and that has been my day of archaeology. Not all archaeological work is in the field!Now it’s back to learning about documentation and recording and exploring more interesting objects.If you are interested in seeing the above mentioned objects for yourself then please visit the SeaCity Museum website.The SeaCity Museum: Environmental Monitoring by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"535","Large pottery sherd from Durrington WallsSo, today is another day of laboratory work for me. I work as a research associate in the BioArCh group at the Department of Archaeology, University of York. I am part of a large team of archaeologists working on the AHRC funded Feeding Stonehenge project, which is investigating the provisioning and consumption patterns of people who lived at Neolithic Durrington Walls – the settlement site associated with the construction of Stonehenge. My role in the project is to analyse the distinctive Grooved Ware pottery for food residues and to see if there were differences in the types of food products that were being consumed by different households, and to see whether certain animals were selected for feasting. I have already looked at over 300 individual pottery sherds, and today I’ll be analysing another 10-20. I’ll also be supervising undergraduate students who have recently started their dissertation projects, working on pottery from other archaeological sites. One student is carrying out work on modern reference pottery that has been used to cook and process marine animals. The results from these experimental studies can be used to help us interpret what we find in archaeological pottery. The day starts off by coming into the lab and switching on the kit in the fume hood – we have to heat the samples to 70 degrees so I have to do this first so it gets up to the right temperature. Then it’s time for the first coffee of the day….There’s me drilling some pottery from Durrington Walls MorningOk so the first step of extracting food residues from pottery is collecting a sample. We do this by taking a modelling drill and scraping out around 1-5 g from the inside of the pot sherd. These have all been photographed and recorded before we start drilling holes in them!Then we add some solvent to the pottery powder and give it a good shake for 15 minutes (there’s actually lab kit that does this for you, you don’t have to stand shaking a tube for 15 mins!). All of the fats that were absorbed into the pottery when it was used in the past dissolve in the solvent. It is incredible to think that food residues would survive for such a long time, but they do!LunchtimeMore coffee! We have a great coffee room in S-Block (the archaeology laboratories at the University of York). Sometimes there’s free cake. None today alas!Bioarchaeology student David prepares some samples for residue analysis.AfternoonOk so we’ve got our solvent containing all those fats from our prehistoric pottery, now we want to find out what’s in it. We take a small amount of the solvent and put it in a machine called a GC/MS which seperates out all of the different fats and compares them to a database to identify what they are. This afternoon there’s a bit of a queue to get stuff done today. We’ll leave the samples running over the weekend, so the results will be ready on monday. And there we go  – a day in the life of the archaeological science team at the University of York! For more updates and information on what we get up to, check out my blog, Castles and Coprolites.

"536","Greetings from Kent County Council’s Community Archaeologist!Since last year’s #dayofarch we have secured funding from HLF for a new project at Shorne Woods in Kent!  Called Shorne HubCAP it aims to involve local people in the archaeology of their area and provide training opportunities for volunteers and local archaeology groups.We are working on a number of sites, from the mesolithic to the medieval. This week we have been finishing a series of test pits on a mesolithic site where we may have an in-situ flint scatter with refitting flakes!We are now pouring all our energies into preparing for a month of archaeology at Shorne Woods Country Park, working on our medieval manor site. We will have re-enactors on site on the 7th and 8th of July, with our community dig running from the 9th to the 29th of July. Do come visit!We will be hosting local schools for the first week and a half, with the opportunity for the children to get involved and help us dig the site.The whole project is indebted to the enthusiasm, knowledge and interest of the many volunteers who take part on a weekly basis. Last year we had 140 different people involved with the summer dig and over 1,000 visitors…Lots of information and pictures on our facebook page www.facebook.com/archaeologyinkentDo get in touch to learn more and to get involved! The Shorne Woods Archaeology Project Update 2012 by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"537","Investigating the Hoard at the British Museum – ConservationUnpacking the HoardThe top of the blockThe hoard reached the Department of Conservation and Research at the British Museum and was worked on by Pippa Pierce and colleagues in the department. Pippa had been involved from the start of the project giving really useful advice both before and after the excavation. The hoard was slowly excavated from its clay block and over time the container and the coins within were revealed. Partially excavatedThe coins within the pot  The coins were excavated stratagraphically to see if there was a structure to the deposits – were the coins at the top more recent than those at the bottom?The excavation showed that there was no difference between the layers and that they had been thoroughly mixed before deposition. What was interesting was that it seems as if the coins were placed in the vessel in small stacks or columns and several groups of coins were removed in this way. In total there were 138 coins all of high denomination -many were very well preserved.The container was revealed to be a local ‘blackware’ vessel called a tyg. Tyg’s are multi-handled drinking cups / mugs. They have several handles as the sides of the pot are thin and the contents are often hot (and highly alcoholic). This meant they could be passed from person to person without burning fingers; it is also thought that the handles segregated the rim and so each person would have their own section and so drinking would be more hygienic. The size of the vessel is about standard for those known from the period (diameter 88mm).  The vessel was slightly cracked and the rim damaged through compression within the soil – so if the finder had tried to lift it without help it could well have broken into many pieces.The purse inside the potImpressions of the coin in the leatherA relatively unique find within the hoard was that the vessel was lined with the well preserved remains of a fine leather purse. The leather is very fragile and the impressions of the coins can be clearly seen preserved within it. Its survival is rare as leather and other organic material seldom survive in the soil. If the finder had dug the hoard himself and emptied the contents of the vessel then it is likely that this unique element would have been severally damaged or lost as it is so fragile. Removing the coinsInside the pot – coins and leatherThe pot and purse See next post: The Bitterley Hoard – Part Three – The CoinsAll images within this blog are used with the kind permission of The British MuseumFor more images see:PAS Flickr Accounthttp://www.flickr.com/photos/finds/ and http://www.flickr.com/photos/finds/sets/72157630327419608/Peter Reavill29th June 2012The The Bitterley Hoard – Part Two – Conservation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"538","Hello from Perth, Western Australia where I want to introduce you to a day in my life. As an archaeologist I am a bit of a hybrid beast. I work as a consultant archaeologist/heritage consultant and run my own consultancy. I also carry out academic research, having a PhD from the University of Western Australia and authoring the first book on WA historical archaeology. I also work as a public archaeologist running public outreach programs and I am authoring a book on WA historical archaeology aimed at the general public. You can check out my varied archaeological personalities at my web page at www.gayenaytonarchaeology.com.When people think of archaeology and archaeologists they think of digging but the truth is most archaeologists spend 90% of their time in the office or lab. I thought for the Day of Archaeology I would take hourly photographs throughout my day to show how my day panned out. I could have been on a site but statistics are against it and this day like many others is going to be spent mainly in the office working on reports. My sister Jackie is helping out my Day of Archaeology project by hanging around and snapping photos every hour.8.30 am Reading e-mails and doing computer admin in jim jams.Photograph by Gaye NaytonMy consultancy is run from a small home office which has the advantage that I get up and jump on the computer to check e-mails without having to wade through rush hour traffic. The internet is my lifeline. Perth is the most isolated city in the world and Western Australia is a huge state taking up a third of the continent. We measure distance here in the number of hours it takes to drive, even getting across the city is measured in driving time. Long distance contacts like the telephone and e-mail are vital for running the consultancy and e-mails and internet discussion lists keep me current with what is going on in the discipline, which is also vital for business as well as research.The consultancy takes on staff on a project by project basis so although for some projects I might have half a dozen archaeologists working for me, often I am working alone. Which means that when it comes to doing all that that non archaeological admin stuff which comes with running a business I am the one that has to find time for it.   I spend a LOT of time at the computer.9.30 report writing – deadline tomorrowPhotograph by Jackie HarryI spend a great deal of time preparing reports, not all of them archaeological. This particular report is a street survey with heritage advice on buildings which may be affected by a proposed development.10.30 drawing maps for reportPhotograph by Jackie HarryWith reports also goes drawing survey maps, sections and artefacts. Many can be drawn on the computer but a light table comes in every handy when you need to make a good copy of your draft. Disadvantage of home office can be size. My current office is too small and work spills out onto the dining room table and sometimes even outside. 11.30 Tea Break: Light relief dancing with mad dogPhotograph by Jackie HarryAll work and no play make a dull day. Advantage of home office where you are the boss, you can turn the music up, jig about and laugh at the red collie dog going mad trying to dance with you. She sings too and the retriever joins in just so he isn’t left out of the fun.12.30 printing report for bindingPhotograph by Gaye NaytonBack to work that report is due tomorrow. 1.30 lunch in gardenPhotograph by Jackie HarryEven a workaholic has to eat 2.30 inspecting concrete pad for new purpose built office and archaeology labPhotograph by Jackie HarryI have a home office so when I downsized the house I downsized the office as well. Now it’s too small and work and archaeologists keep spilling out into the dining room or the back patio. So I am moving again but this time I am building a purpose built office and archaeology lab in the back garden. I will still have the conveniences and perils of a home office but in a space large enough for the office, artefact storage and artefact analysis. The concrete pad went down yesterday. Exciting! 3.30 Updating web sitePhotograph by Jackie HarryI have a new web page at www.gayenaytonarchaeology.com I am trying to update it with the essence of 19 years of consultancy work (as clients give permission), with 23 years of academic research and 22 years of public archaeology. It’s a bit of a task. Because I am passionate about public archaeology I have included links for educators, guidelines for heritage managers and a kit of instructions for running archaeological fun day activities. 4.30 Photographing artefacts for my bookPhotograph by Jackie HarryThis is my portable artefact photographic studio. Lucky it is portable because at the moment it moves back and forth between the dining room table and my workshop storage. It will be permanently set up in the new lab. I am photographing an artefact to include in the book I am currently authoring with the working title The Archaeology of US: Archaeological Stories from Australia’s Northwest Frontier. The book is intended for a public not academic audience and the tea pot in the picture is one of the artefacts I use to construct a short fictional scenario based on real people and real artefacts to illustrate an archaeological point. 5.30 Report writing second reportPhotograph by Jackie HarryOne report ends and it’s onto the next deadline. This report is archaeological, a monitoring project recording stratigraphy and artefacts revealed by removing and replacing a stretch of river wall.6.30 Dinner with sisPhotograph by Gaye NaytonA quick bite of dinner to say thank you to sis for helping out with the Day of Archaeology Project.   The A Day in the Life of Gaye Nayton, Heritage Archaeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"542","Like any job in archaeology, working with small finds can be a bit of a mixed bag. For every box opened to reveal shiny ‘treasure’ there are countless others containing more prosaic yet interesting finds which are indicative of everyday life and activities in the past. These are really the ‘best bit’ of any assemblage but more numerous still on many urban sites are boxes full of highly fragmentary and corroded ‘dross’. Some of this is completely unidentifiable, fairly undiagnostic (such as fragments of iron sheet or wire) or else tantalisingly close to being a recognisable object leading to some speculative flicking through likely find’s books or trips around the office to bother colleagues.Today I am working on a post-excavation assessment report for an interesting Roman site in Southwark and it is no exception. This morning I’ll be dealing with some more of the most corroded horrible bulk nails it’s ever been my misfortune to handle (don’t expect any terribly enlightening updates about these) but this afternoon I have some more nice Roman glass to round off the week so stick with me. There are lovely glass vessels in this assemblage and some evidence for glass working – probably the first evidence of this sort from south of the river.In the meantime I’m off to grab some gloves and some more boxes of nails. At least it’s a bit cooler today. I grew up in Scotland and so anything above about 24°C is a bit on the warm side for me and it was horrible yesterday when it topped 31 degrees in the office. I was wearing gloves and a dust mask and had to close the windows and turn off the fan in my section of the office to stop all the dust, rust and muck from the nails choking the osteologists and finds specialists I share a room with. For the present here’s a photo of my rather generic desk in that room to contrast with all the lovely site photos that I’m seeing appearing on the website already. This is ‘where the magic happens’… or something like that.

"544","When it rains in Auckland it really rains. It’s not this kinda British light drizzle that takes hours before your waterproofs decide not to be waterproof any more. It falls from the sky in bulk. And usually it lasts for about 45 seconds. Rain woke us up this morning in our flat in one of the oldest houses in Auckland, described by a friend of mine as ‘almost like the White House’. The ‘almost’ bit denotes one tenth of the size, one hundredth of the splendour and one thousandth of the recognizability. It is quite nice regardless, with a bar downstairs and a massive garden which is in fact the university campus, the Old Government House serves its purpose well – it hosts visiting researchers at the University of Auckland. Such as us.Two archaeologists, one specializing in Human Origins the other in Roman studies, are not a common sight on the island colonized no earlier than AD 1250-1300 but this time the research project generously funded by a World Universities Network (@WUNSouthamptonU) grant was all about methods rather than specific time periods. In fact it was all about complexity.[Click to enlarge]Remember how when you were a kid you liked to take your toys apart and how difficult it was to put them back together without asking mummy for help? Complexity science is just about the same thing but instead of mummy we have computer simulations. The goal is to figure out how complex phenomena (like human behaviour to name the most obvious one) are created from simple interactions between simple agents (like the neurons in your brain). Funny it’s not called simplexity.Our project has been designed to investigate the behaviour of hunter-gatherers in a highly unpredictable environment. We are particularly interested in their dependence on two different information sources: a culturally transmitted mental map/template of resource distribution (in this case the waterholes) and immediate environmental cues gathered from their surroundings. It was inspired by the Australian Aboriginal groups of non-coastal parts of Australia where human groups have developed a highly complex set of orally transmitted stories/myths (so-called dreamtime) which encode the location of waterholes and other resources.Sounds like a proper piece of archaeological speculation but in fact it consists of endless programming hours, dropping into despair over the code reporting errors that no one knows how to solve and stretching our A-level maths acquired a decade ago and swiftly forgotten about a month later.[Click to enlarge]So here we are pretending that staring at the computer screen will make the yellow message ‘you can’t use step_by_step in an observer context, because it is a turtle/patch only’ disappear (if you know how to get rid of this error message, please DO get in touch). We use a humanities-students-friendly programming platform – NetLogo but what seems friendly to a computer scientist (and apparently 6 grade kids who are supposed to use it to learn their maths) can be pretty tricky to the history/languages/maybe-a-bit-of-geography archaeology graduate. Slowly, we’re moving on and the model is gaining momentum. A little green fella (he’s actually a group but it doesn’t matter) walks on an imaginary landscape of prehistoric Australia dotted with occasional waterholes. If he doesn’t make it to the next active one by the time he dehydrates he dies. He dies a lot. But to help him out we allowed him to remember where some of the waterholes encountered before are (that’s the glorified ‘mental template’). He still dies a lot but we’re working on it.The project is being developed by 3 PhD students – two from the University of Southampton (@tombrughmans and I) and one from the University of Auckland and supervised by two University of Auckland professors. When the green fella finally manages to survive for a respectable period of time we will analyse which strategy was the most successful one, write it all up and present at a conference.

"545","It’s a lovely day (at the moment), and I am sitting in my garden office, looking at two monitors, and with two notebooks in front of me. Friday is usually my day for consolidating to-do lists, and sorting out a supplementary ‘when to-do’ list which wraps around meetings and travel plans for the next week.A snapshot of my current list includes: proofreading The Archaeologistsetting up a IfA Practice Papers reviewConference 2013 business planwrite/ edit/ deliver eBulletinreview Communications and Recruitment strategyproject design for ‘A client toolkit; archaeology, development and planning in 2013’Not a lot on there to do with the perceived job as a traditional archaeologist – but then, as is noticeable from other blogs, the life of an archaeologist in 2012 isn’t always (or often) one of fieldwork, investigation and discovery.I work for the Institute of Archaeologists, a UK based professional institute for archaeologists anywhere in the world. We are a member organisation with a specific remit of setting standards for the study and care of the historic environment. The Institute is driven by a strategic vision (it’s on our website) and along with the very practical and administrative list if things to do, IfA’s big visionary targets are designed to have an impact: to raise the profile of archaeology and improve the status of archaeologists in society, to inspire excellence in professional practice, develop a stronger influence over policy affecting the historic environment, and to give archaeologists a credible, effective and efficient professional institute.This year IfA are moving ever closer to making an application to become a Chartered Institute – for me it’s a really exciting prospect and an equally exciting time to be working for the professional body. I am passionate about archaeology (especially vikings in the North Atlantic, and longhouses in Cumbria!), and I come from a background of archaeological research, commercial post excavation management and teaching (mainly with postgraduates). What I have realised as my career has developed, is that I am also passionate about the profession of archaeology, and about the professional status of archaeologists. My job at IfA suits me. Not only do I get the opportunity to shout about how great and how important archaeology is, but I get to promote the need to do it properly, to work to professional standards and to encompass an ethical code of conduct to all archaeologists.Today’s list may seem to be strictly administrative from some angles. From the one I’m working from, I can see how each ‘thing to do’ contributes to the overall vision and strategy which IfA has. The next issue of The Archaeologist (due out next month) reviews changes which our sector is facing, includes an interview with the Digventures team (who are trying out novel funding streams for archaeological digs), and summarises the current situation with jobs in British Archaeology. Setting up a review of current IfA Practice papers will ensure they are up-to-date, and that they cover the issues and techniques archaeologists want to know about. Every year the IfA conference includes three days of research, sector discussions, debates and training opportunities. The conference brings together 400 archaeologists who represent the full spectrum of the UK profession. In 2013 we will be descending on Birmingham – and sorting out the business plan is the first important step in making it happen. Every month we send out an eBulletin to all our members, providing an update on sector news, signposting to surveys, conferences and training, and letting members know what IfA staff and committees have been up to. The Communications and Recruitment Strategy is the tool that shapes my own job – essentially what should we be saying, to whom should be saying it? And using what means? The Recruitment strategy focuses on members – current and future. How do we be sure that our current membership is happy? How do we continue to recruit new members? Finally, the client toolkit is an idea I had when discussing how I could start to communicate the big messages to those non archaeologists who employ us, work alongside us and should benefit from the work we do. We need to make sure that everyone knows that archaeology is important, that it has a purpose and a role in society, and that archaeologists are professionals. It’s a challenge, but a worthwhile one.So, back to today. Once this is complete, I can get back to responding to the mornings emails, then go and make myself a cuppa. It’s going to be a busy day.   The Promoting Professional Archaeology – My Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"546","My name is Rebecca Jones and I’m a Romanist. My regular work at RCAHMS is as an Operational Manager in the Survey and Recording group where I am responsible for Data and Recording, overseeing a range of projects relating to the data in our online database, Canmore, and its mapping application, and working in partnership across the sector to deliver information to the public. Information Management is one strand of my research interests but another is very firmly placed in Roman military archaeology.View of the eastern defences of the Roman fort at Ardoch (©Rebecca Jones 2008)Scotland is one of the best places in the Roman empire to study the archaeology of the Roman army. Repeated attempts to conquer Scotland left a legacy of remains that are the envy of the rest of the Roman world. One of the places where this is most evident is the Roman fort of Ardoch in Perthshire.  This is the location of one of the best earthwork Roman forts in Britain, and the plain to the north of the fort was a marshalling ground for large armies on campaign through Perthshire to the north.The fort itself was occupied several times leaving a legacy of multiple ditches still surviving as earthworks. I have accompanied several tours of the site and visitors never fail to be impressed by the scale of the defences. Some of these were excavated in the late 19th century by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and some of the photographs from those excavations are amongst the most fascinating early excavation shots held in the Collections at RCAHMS.But not only is the fort an amazing site. To the north lie at least five marching camps. These were temporary structures occupied by invading armies who were housed in rows upon rows of leather tents. We are fortunate that they built ramparts and ditches around the perimeter of their encampments, for it is these that leave visible archaeological remains. Imagine a field of tents from T in the Park or Glastonbury: after the weekend is over and the tents have gone – what have you left? No doubt a sea of litter but the Roman’s did not live in our disposable culture. Once the litter is cleared you probably have a muddy field. But then six months later? Is there any evidence that those tents were there? But if a regular perimeter rampart and ditch with particular rounded corners and entrance protection is built, then that leaves an archaeological footprint that we can detect as Roman. The majority of the camps at Ardoch have been levelled through centuries of ploughing and only the perimeter ditch can be seen from the air through differential cropmarkings in dry summers, although stretches of three still survive as upstanding earthworks.Rebecca Jones explaining the camps at ArdochA handful of other camps in Scotland have revealed internal rubbish pits and ovens through aerial and geophysical survey and excavation but for most camps, it is the perimeter which we can identify. The camps at Ardoch witnessed one of the largest Roman forces that ever took to the field in Britain, with the largest camp enclosing over 54 hectares / 130 acres.It’s this combined evidence of the transient Roman army plus the troops stationed in the fort here for several years, that make these seemingly peaceful fields in Perthshire so fascinating.The Rebecca Jones RCAHMS Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"547","Iron Age display in Letchworth Museum, June 2012 © North Hertfordshire District CouncilLetchworth Museum, with its displays of local archaeology, will be closing to the public in September 2012. For once, that’s not one of these all-too-common tales of woe from a public sector that is cutting its soft targets to balance its books. It’s all to do with investment in a new district museum that will tell the story of North Hertfordshire, which is due to open in 2014.In the meantime, I am working on understanding the objects in our collection that will best illustrate that story. Currently, we do not have a complete catalogue of the hundreds of thousands of archaeological objects held by the Museums Service. True, we have an Accessions Register stored in four ledgers that go back to the opening of Letchworth Museum in 1915 (and, fittingly, the first entry is for a collection of sixteen English silver coins that are curated as part of the archaeological collection). However, they are only partly computerised and, for the earlier entries, the information they contain is minimal. To compound matters still further, there has been no systematic entry of excavated material (much of it excavated by the Museums Service itself from the 1970s to 1990s), most of which remains unaccessioned.As a compromise solution, I decided to create a stand-alone database detailing everything that is in our collection. Working on it for one day a week for several months, I have now reached 2761 objects, the last entry being a small jar from a Romano-British cemetery in Baldock, excavated in 1928 (and accessioned on 15 May 1928). At this rate of progress, I ought to be finished in about thirty years! Thankfully, with help from our dedicated band of volunteers, it ought to be finished before the new museum is opened.It is a truism that only a tiny fraction of a museum’s collections can ever be displayed at any time. With the archaeological objects from North Hertfordshire, it’s well under 1% of the collection. Most of the material will never be displayed because it consists of seemingly unpromising potsherds, broken tile, animal bones and so on. Of course, we need to keep this material for further research, usually carried out by outsiders from research institutions such as universities. In this way, the service has contributed parts of a Bronze Age collared urn for lipid analysis (it had formerly contained a milk-based substance), human vertebrae with evidence for tuberculosis (of six samples submitted, four tested positive for TB) and a collection of material excavated at Ravensburgh Castle in 1964 that has been borrowed for analysis and publication.The outside of the Burymead Museums Resouce Centre, HitchinMost of our archaeological material is stored at the Museums Resource Centre at the Bury Mead industrial estate in Hitchin. This is where I am based much of the time, although I also work in Letchworth and Hitchin Museums, where I am available to give advice (including identifying artefacts) to members of the public. The service moved into the buildings in 1990 as a temporary measure and, twenty-two years later, we seem to be here more-or-less permanently. A purpose built bulk store (for non-sensitive archaeological material) was constructed in 1991; it has twenty-seven bays of roller racking and four bays of fixed shelving, which are full to capacity. Archaeological small finds were also moved here temporarily in 2003, but will be moved into better storage shortly.Over half of the archaeological collection comes from excavations in Baldock. This is as a result of three large campaigns of excavation: the excavation of an extensive Roman cemetery site by Percival Westell of Letchworth Museum from 1925 to 1930, the excavation of several large areas of the Roman town by Ian Stead of the British Museum from 1968 to 1972 and numerous excavations in advance of development by Gil Burleigh of Letchworth Museum from 1978 to 1994. The site has yielded some spectacular finds, including the earliest Welwyn-type burial ever found (it dates from no later than 100 BCE). There is also a large collection of material from an important but sadly poorly known prehistoric settlement at Blackhorse Road in Letchworth Garden City, excavated by John Moss-Eccardt of Letchworth Museum from 1957 to 1974, where there was extensive Late Neolithic and Iron Age occupation as well as the only Anglo-Saxon cemetery excavated in North Hertfordshire. Recently, the Museums Service acquired the material from Guy Beresford’s excavation of the deserted settlement of Caldecote from 1974 to 1976, which has a good range of medieval pottery (including a complete St Neots Ware cooking pot of probably tenth-century date).I find it a real privilege to curate such an extensive, diverse and important collection of objects. There are enough display worthy Iron Age and Roman brooches to fill a museum with them alone; the same goes for Iron Age and Roman coins or for prehistoric flint artefacts. Much as a specialist would appreciate this sort of display, it wouldn’t help us tell the story of North Hertfordshire. True, there are challenges. A lot of the material acquired in the early days is poorly provenanced or not even from the area; there are even some exotic objects (we have a small collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts, for instance) that we are no longer part of our collections policy. In a way, this stuff is part our local story: it tells us about Victorian and early twentieth-century collectors and about what was thought appropriate for local museums to hold. As work progresses on determining exactly which stories the new museum will tell and with which objects, we will be blogging about it on our own dedicated museums website.The Museum Archaeology in North Hertfordshire by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"549","Who is an archeologist? – This might seem an easy question and in some cases it might be, for example if you work as an archaeologist or if you have a degree in archaeology. Then again there are several trades that deal somewhat with archaeology, for example a guide at museum, an author or an journalist that write about archaeology, that doesn’t require an archaeological degree or that you’ve worked as an archaeologist. Others might have a degree in archaeology but has worked or intended to work as an archaeologist. The last six months I’ve been part of a work group for the Swedish Union DIK ( Link in Swedish) to set down ethical guidelines for archaeology. The work is not done but it’s been interesting to read other ethical guidelines, for example the EAA and the AAA and sit down and discuss ethical issues as well as issues’ concerning what is archaeology and who is an archaeologist.Now this was not what I was intending to write about, but it works well as an introduction as this post can be seen as the description of one kind of archaeology – let’s call it antiquarian archaeology or perhaps better official agency archaeology.My name is Magnus Reuterdahl, I’m a Swedish based archaeologist currently working at Östergötland County Administrative Board (Länsstyrelsen i Östergötland ) with social planning and cultural heritage. My archaeological journey stretches from the most northern parts of Sweden to the most southern parts, from Haparanda to Sölvesborg, and it has also taken me abroad on research projects such as the Yangsahoproject that aims for China. I’ve worked for Stockholm University as an osteologist, I’ve worked with contract archaeology for several museums and private companies where I’ve done excavations and surveys and I’ve worked for and work for a couple of government agencies.As this is Day of Archaeology I’d thought I’d shed some light on what I do as an archaeologist at a government agency, in the case a County Administrative board. As you might guess a lot of what I do concerns administration of different sorts, decisons, answering questions regarding developments and site planning, assessing the need for archaeological protection or work in diffrent kinds of situations. Furthermore, we deal with issues concerning archaeological conservation, ancient monuments, cultural reserves and national interest in cultural heritage management. Prior to forestry, we help forest owners with the pointing out and marking ancient monuments and give notice of the protective measures that may be needed, we also answer several questions from the government and parliament if necessary etc. etc. IN other words we are the goverments extended hand out to citizens on a local level.My day normally means I’m sitting behind a desk, in front of the computer, working via the phone, internet and with GIS-programs using my head rather than collecting soil under my finger nails. This might sound boring but really it’s not, I get to be part of processes, seeing how society is formed and reformed and in a best case scenario in harmony with the cultural heritage. I get to meet and talk to many interesting persons and constantly read up on what’s going on in archaeology right now and sometimes also be part of forming it through decisons and answers.I wont lie to you though, when the wheather is good you long for some outdoor jobs and sometimes I also get to leave my office, as yesterday when I went check up on a tip regarding a previously unknown ancient monument. Most often these tips turns out to be either historical remains such as clearing cairns, foundations of crofts or other remains of different kinds of activities such as coal mining or forestry. These are also of great interest to us but as many parts of Sweden is well surveyed for ancient monuments and remains it’s kind of cool to find something “new” ancient. The cairn was reported by forestry workers doing forest thinning work at Omberg on east side of lake Vettern.This time it was prehistoric grave, a cairn, ca 13 meters in diameter, 0,5-0,6 meter high, built with rounded rocks ca 0,2-0,6 meter big and probably from the Bronze Age or Iron Age.Finds like these are important as they give evidence that there are still much to be found even in areas that we believe are well surveyed, such as Omberg, and that there is value in teaching those who work with forestry about our culture heritage and how to avoid damaging it.Magnus Reuterdahl, Östergötland County Administrative Board.

"550","My name is Spencer Gavin Smith and I am writing my PhD thesis on ‘Parks, Gardens and Designed Landscapes of Medieval North Wales and North West Shropshire’. I’m using a combination of archaeology, history, literature and the visual arts to tell the story of the development of these landscapes during the medieval period. I’m particularly interested in the social relationships which existed between the English and Welsh royal and noble families and how their relationships can manifest themselves in the archaeological record.Today I’m working on the PhD chapter which looks at designed landscapes. These can be temporary landscapes, for example a field full of tents for a diplomatic meeting or a tournament, which are removed once business has been concluded; or they can be permanent landscapes, for example, where a castle is constructed which has built into it a particular set of meanings which will be understood by people visiting the site subsequently.The featured image shows the survey carried out of a motte and bailey castle in North-East Wales called Sycharth. It is most famous for being the home of Owain Glyn Dŵr, who led a revolt in the 15th century against the English Crown. But, the castle has a much longer history than just that one event.The image shows the results of a metal detecting survey carried out, and the finds are mapped out in two colours to distinguish between ferrous (iron) and non-ferrous finds (brass, tin or copper for example). Some of these finds are likely to date from a meeting which was held here in the early 13th century. By looking at the chemical composition of the ferrous finds it might be possible to identify different metalworking techniques and sources of the iron, and these could be compared to other ferrous finds which have been made in other parts of Wales and the rest of Britain.  The Parks, Gardens and Designed Landscapes of Medieval North Wales and North West Shropshire by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"552","I’m Susan Hamilton. I work in the Survey and Recording section at RCAHMS, and am responsible for a number of data-led projects, which include exciting work sharing our database with a number of partners, for example the National Trust for Scotland, the Orkney Council Archaeology Service and the Garden History Society in Scotland.I’ve chosen the Island of Inchkeith, in the Firth of Forth.  Located in a strategic defensive position in the middle of the Firth, it helped protect the important Port of Leith and the City of Edinburgh as well as the sheltered anchorage provided by the Forth.  As a result, it is covered in defensive structures, some of which date from the 16th century.Today, some of the most visible remains are the concrete and brick shells of the First and Second World War defences.  I’ve been on fieldwork on Inchkeith and was struck by the evocative nature of the island.  It has been more or less uninhabited since the end of the Second World War, and in some parts it is hard to believe it is almost 70 years since up to 1000 service personnel were stationed here. In a number of the buildings, wooden rifle racks and shelves for helmets survive by the entrances. Observation posts retain painted regimental badges on the walls and small tables where maps and plans (or the daily rotas) may have been laid out.For me, what is interesting about places like Inchkeith is that they demonstrate the massive changes that the infrastructure of the Second World War imposed on the Scottish landscape.  Although this island fortress may be an extreme example, it reflects the very real fear of invasion and the threat of aerial attack under which people lived.  Sometimes it seems easy to present a British view of the conflict coloured by ‘Dads’ Army’ and ‘Boys Own adventures’.  As we enter a period when there will be fewer and fewer survivors telling their stories, we need places like Inchkeith to remind us of the difficulties and folly of war. The Susan Hamilton, Data Upgrade and Liaison Officer RCAHMS by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"553","A week in the life of a FLO – Wendy Scott, Leicestershire and Rutland FLO and Rebecca Czechowicz, FLA.MondayI added records to the database from an elderly long-term finder. We visited him at home last week and recorded objects found many years ago, before the scheme started here. We obtained accurate locations using maps and had a chat about his best find, a small but significant Viking coin hoard –The Thurcaston Hoard.TuesdayMore inputting  (it never stops!).  In the run up to the Festival of Archaeology, myself and my manager have a meeting with our press office to plan our press releases. This year we have 73 festival events to promote, including a launch event at Kirby Muxloe Castle with EH (14th July), an event to promote a new Iron age coin hoard going into Harborough museum with coin striking activities (17th July).We are also plugging two Leicestershire objects being in the final 10 of Britain’s Secret Treasures, an ITV programme highlighting the 50 most important finds made by the public (16th-22nd July).We have help from a volunteer today. James Kirton is helping us to get all the amazing Bosworth Roman objects onto the database.  Amongst hundreds of brooches, we have 99 horse and rider brooches! Along with coins and other objects; all found as part of the Bosworth battlefield survey.WednesdayWe have an appointment at Oakham Museum to meet a finder to record her many objects. Rebecca measures and weighs whilst I photograph and identify all the objects. Handily this co-incides with an invitation to visit Time Team filming at Oakham castle. We met up with Danni, FLO for Devon who works for Time Team, and local detectorist Dr Phil Harding who was detecting the spoil for them, to see what they’d found. A local journalist asked the other Dr Phil Harding if he actually did the digging! He was posing for a photo with a spade at the time,  so he replied “What do you think I do with this?”Our Dr Phil detects the spoil whilst the other one supervises his trench.ThursdayDownloading and editing photos and researching objects from our recording yesterday, ready to add them to the database.  I have spoken to the finder of the IA hoard. We are arranging a photo opportunity for the press next week, prior to the event and I needed a quote for the press release. I also spoke to colleagues about one of our museums purchasing a treasure case, a medieval finger ring, for their collection. In the afternoon we were all distracted from work by a violent thunderstorm, with flash flooding and hail the size of golfballs!FridayDay of Archaeology! Today I am getting on with recording the objects we identified yesterday. I am also preparing leaflets and flyers for the Festival. Before I leave I will be gathering material for a weekend event. Sunday is the annual open day at Burrough Hill fort, Leicestershire’s best Iron Age fort. The University of Leicester are conducting a five year research project there.  We will have the latest finds along with other Iron Age and Roman objects from the area found by detecting and field-walking. We have Iron age Warriors, coin making and I will be on hand to record anything that people bring along.With the exception of Time Team being in my area, this is a pretty average summer week. There are always more objects to record and input, events to organise and promote and people to see. . . . . The A Week in the Life of a FLO (And Her Helpers) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"554","Sandwick, known locally as the Easting, is an east-facing bay with a gently shelving, broad sandy beach on the Isle of Unst, Shetland. Sloping up from the bay is a hillside where you can see the substantial remains of Sandwick township, comprising the unroofed and collapsing walls of dwellings, barns, byres, and enclosures that housed and sustained a community of farmers and fishermen in the historic past.I first visited Easting in 2009 with the Scotland’s Rural Past project to undertake field survey training with Unst Archaeology group, and begin a school project with Uyeasound primary school. Our initial recce visit revealed an amazingly rich archaeological landscape, with the footings of older, perhaps Norse buildings underlying several of the farmsteads.Elsewhere there were signs of prehistoric occupation, including a reconstructed Iron Age building, the original eroding into the sea and excavated by the local community together with the SCAPE trust, and the low sub-rectangular turf and boulder bank of a previously unrecorded Neolithic dwelling. Clearly this fertile landscape had been valued as a place able to support a farming community over several thousand years.A surprising piece of evidence for an historic farming economy could be seen in the remains of a Norse farmstead eroding out of the sand dunes down on the beach. Excavated in the late 1970’s and occupied during the 13th – 14th centuries it shows the same basic layout as the historic farmsteads further up the hill; with a dwelling at one end of the building, and a byre at the other.This building leaves no doubt as to which end was which. The entrance into the north end is cow-shaped! The walls at the foot of the door are narrow and the doorway gradually widens as it goes up, just as the width of a cow increases with its height from hooves to belly. This discovery finally solved the puzzling problem of the dimensions of excavated Norse byre entrances being too narrow for cattle to pass through.It can sometimes be difficult to look at an archaeological site and imagine what it was and how people used it. This doorway’s profile helped me make a mental picture of the Norse farmers of Sandwick and their cattle of long ago (as illustrated by my colleague Danny’s useful impression).The Brian Wilkinson Britain From Above Activity Officer RCAHMS by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"556","The work of the Portable Antiquities Scheme sometimes throws up moments of pure joy and excitement, when all the pieces fall into place and the hard work of many years pays off. An example of this can be seen in the discovery of the Bitterley hoard declared treasure today (28th June 2012) at an inquest in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.The Bitterley hoardThe hoard was discovered by Howard Murphy, an experienced and keen metal detector user who regularly reports his finds to me at Ludlow Museum Resource Centre. Howard and I met a number of years ago when he came on a course run through Shropshire Museums. This course looked at practical ways archaeological sites could be interrogated, culminating in a season of fieldwalking on a Romano-British site in North Herefordshire. This course relied on two key concepts, provenance and context.Fieldwalking a Romano-British site on the Shropshire / Herefordshire border. Howard Murphy – Middle of groupThe DiscoveryThe first I heard about this find was a phone call late one evening in February – it was from Howard – he said ‘I’ve found a hoard – a pot full of silver coins – and I’ve left it in the ground for you’. Howard is from Yorkshire and it takes a bit to ruffle his feathers – but there was a quiver in his voice –he was worried – had he done the right thing? We arranged for me to go out to the site over the weekend and have a look. We were both concerned that if we left it someone else would come and take it away, but the findspot was (thankfully) well off the beaten track and out of sight of prying eyes.Howard and his holeOn the visit we had a good look at the surrounding area, Howard pointed to the area he had found the coins and we quickly took the soil back out of his hole. At the bottom were a group of silver Elizabethan coins glinting in the light and we could just make out an area of the rim of a thin walled pot. I knew that we couldn’t do anything then so we back filled the hole and made the site look as undisturbed as possible – this included moving a large number of mole hills to blend the findspot with the surrounding field.The find was made on land under semi-permanent pasture. It had a series of interesting low earthworks and the remains of a hollow-way nearby. From what we had seen we had no idea what the underlying archaeology might be. The hoard could be inside a house or a ditch and there could be other things associated with it. We also had no idea of the size of the hoard – whether there were just 20 coins or many more.  The only way to find this out was to dig it up – and so we arranged a full rescue excavation for the following week.The Excavation:Tom BrindleWe decided that a small number of people were needed and so we kept things very local, Howard with his detector and spade, Tom Brindle (FLO for Staffordshire and the West Mids) came along to help with the digging and recording and the farmer also lent a hand. The weather was typical for February, although the day stayed relatively dry. When we got to the site; it was clear that no-one else had found it and the hoard was still safely in place – the first stage was to record the hole that Howard had dug. Section and plan of the finders excavation      Once this had been done we cut a larger trench with the hoard at the centre. We cleared the turf and topsoil cleaning the soil back at a layer just above the hoard. We were looking for any traces of a pit or other archaeology present, especially changes in colour and texture in the soil. This was tricky given the conditions but everything seems to be very uniform and most importantly the soil had little evidence of other material such as brick, tile or pottery. These factors led us to believe that the site was not directly associated with a building (with walls or floors) or other feature such as a ditches and pits.With no archaeology showing in plan – a small sondage (section) was cut close to the vessel to see if anything could be seen in section – like the profile of a pit. Unfortunately nothing could be seen and the section was all uniform until the natural undisturbed clay was reached. Again – this was drawn planned and described.With no other buried archaeology present we decided to lift the hoard in a single block – this is always a worrying operation as we knew the size at the top – but not the base – so the soil was removed to leave a single column of soil and excavated to a depth well below the natural. It was then supported with cling film and bandages – and then slowly undermined. Luckily the soil was wet and solid and the block stayed in one piece, coming from the ground after more than 300 years. It was packed up in a box and taken to the museum in Ludlow.The undermining and liftThe hoard itself was kept refrigerated (in an old fridge from the staff room) to inhibit the growth of mould and to stop the surrounding soil drying and cracking – we had no idea what was inside (and museum colleagues had to find somewhere else to store their milk and packed lunches).We had to wait several months before the hoard could be taken to London and the staff at Conservation and Research Department, at the British Museum could work on it – but the wait was well worth it.Tom Brindle Finishing up the recordingCleaning up and going homeSee next post: The Bitterley Hoard – Part Two – ConservationFor more images  see:PAS Flickr Accounthttp://www.flickr.com/photos/finds/ and http://www.flickr.com/photos/finds/sets/72157630327419608/ Peter Reavill29th June 2012The The Bitterley Hoard – Part One – Discovery and Excavation by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The material manifestation of religious practice, ritual and magic if you will, have always fascinated me. It sounds trite, but it is true.

"560","It’s an early morning for me, earlier than usual. I have two archaeology jobs these days – one as the webmaster for archaeologyfieldwork.com, and also my full time job working for a government agency in the northeast US. I wake at 4am and have just enough time to post some new archaeology jobs to the website, then it’s a quick rush to get ready for work!I am adhering to the schedule of a subconsultant doing work on our property. An environmental company is planning a soil remediation project, essentially stripping away dirt that has tested as contaminated, and removing it from the site. Generally one thinks of archaeologists as the ones doing the digging, but today I will be watching someone else digging.This is only my second week on the job, and the first time I’ve been in the field in a long time. I’m still learning the ropes at my employer and figuring out the right people to talk to, where to look up information, and even mundane things like where various equipment is located.I’ve gathered the requisite equipment and spent time mentally preparing for the job at hand. Before you go into the field, there are certain steps that need to be taken. Part of the process is doing research on the area where you will be working. I needed to figure out what previously recorded archaeological and historical sites were in the vicinity of the project area, and what was found. Geographic information system (GIS) maps and site files are consulted in the search. Soil survey maps are also studied and can provide something of a preview of what you can expect to encounter. It’s important to also know the topography of a project area – is the landform flat, a severe slope, a hilltop? Related information is also important such as proximity to a water source (including seasonal water sources, or even one that existed only in the past). Some predictive models have been developed using those factors and other criteria to provide an educated guess on where sites may be found. Knowing something about the history of an area is also helpful. Is the project area near known Native American trails, or historic routes? Were structures present? What do we know about land use here in the last few hundred years? Archaeologists try to arm themselves with as much information as possible before an excavation ever occurs, however, you really don’t know what’s out there until you conduct fieldwork.I did my homework, packed my truck, and headed out to the site to meet the contractors. I’m usually a bit obsessive about being early, but following a slow moving dump truck on dusty roads for miles and miles, I show up just on time. The contaminated soil is in association with a historic structure whose foundation remains. The contractors spend a bit of time debating the various methods of removing the soil, and I busy myself taking measurements  and photos of the ruins and proposed excavation. Nothing too exciting here from an archaeological perspective, even for someone enamored of historics like myself. Poking around the fill in the foundation turns up a few modern artifacts – sewer drainage pipe, PVC plumbing and plastics.The excavator begins to strip the top few feet of soil, which is recent fill. I find a dark colored lens with charred wood in the excavated wall, likely a modern burn episode. The excavator operator is a local and informs me this is where trash was sometimes burned behind the structure. I ask more questions about the surroundings and compare the info given with my previous research. It’s often beneficial to hear what folks have to say, and sometimes you can obtain useful information. Any archaeologist who has been working in the field long enough can tell you stories about how a local informant clued them in to what was really going on (and usually where the real sites were).The excavation comes to a halt, as there is a delay in bringing containers on site from another contractor. After spending time waiting for the containers to show up, the decision is made to cease operations for the day. I pack up and drive back to the office to write up my notes. The containers may not be arriving until next week, so I shift my attention to the next project and put this on the back burner for now. Shovel testing is planned for Friday at another site, and I need to complete my research before heading out. And so the cycle begins anew.

"561","I’m hoping today will be quite quiet on the email / phone call front as Fridays often are, allowing me to get on with some finds. I’m afraid it makes for quite a boring day in the life, but the worn Roman coins and Post Medieval buckles are more representative of a FLO’s lot than shiny gold treasure, unfortunately.I start the day with a discussion with a colleague about a new idea to possibly draw together a group of finds to make a short publication, however that will need to wait until my own time so I am trying to be good, put it to one side and focus on my proper work for the day.I’m working on a group of finds from one finder. He is a metal detectorist so mostly metal finds but he also picks up pottery when he sees it. Helpfully he has bagged each find and labelled them with the field they came from and the date he found them. I start by checking them against the receipt to see that I have everything I should. As a FLO people put huge trust in us when they lend us their finds for recording and losing a find is one of every FLO’s worse nightmares.Then I group them into piles. I realise some of the pot was put away slightly wet and although the bags were pierced it has still grown some mould so I get them out to dry off.Normally I would finish the records and photograph the items before promoting them to public view but today I hope to promote them as I go along so you can see the progress. I’ll see if I can work out how to post the links to them but in the meantime just looking at www.finds.org.uk/database and searching under SOMERSET as the county should bring up the most recent things recorded.The Somerset Finds Liaison Officer by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"562","It looks like I’m going to be spending most of today sorting photos and writing indices to add to a report on survey work I did on Monday. Already I’m struggling to remember which building footings are which in a large, spread post-mediaeval township in Strathdearn which, although a SAM, is under threat of being surrounded by commercial forestry. that includes enclosure and removal of grazing. At present the township is well managed by the grazing sheep and has a lovely cover of wild flowers ( a great distraction during survey) but the client is giving up on sheep and is diversifying into conifers. So, like so many other fantastic sites in the Highlands, this ine will, if the scheme goes ahead, gradually disappear under coarse grasses, bracken and ultimately shrubs. What landowner is going to commit to, and keep to the commitment of, a long-term programme of management of their archaeology within forestry?What else is occupying me today? Whether or not to apply to be site supervisor on a local comunity dig. It’d be great to scrape the rust off the trowel, but all the comercial clients still awaiting completion of evaluation reports will not share my pleasure. Speaking of which, back to those photos.

As we had a gig last night, I’m currently an archaeologist who plays in a band and also has a *slight* hangover.Anywho, I’m trying to think my way through what it means to do this thing, to be an archaeologist who plays in a band, and the thing that I keep coming back to is that I do both things because I care about them. I love playing in a band, being on stage is a massive high, and the boys I play with are my brothers (one of them actually by birth, technically). I became an archaeologist cos I enjoyed it, and am passionate about it. The people you meet while working as an archaeologist will similarly have your back through thick and thin. In both cases there’s an almost familial bond with the people you work and/or create with.For both of these endeavours, its you against the world, through thick and thin. Commercial Archaeology can be a hard industry to work in, the pay is generally crap, the pressure and stress can be abominable. But, the love for this thing we do, and the strength you gain from the people around you sees you through to the end of every week. Being in a band, and attempting to make it, there is rejection after rejection. People promising the world, but delivering only dust, wind and the rolling of tumble-weeds. But, you do it cos you love it, and the guys you share a stage with help you get through it.And lets not even mention the need to burn the candle at both ends! Getting up at 6am to go run a site is decidedly less than fun if you’ve headlined a gig the night before and only gotten home at 1am.But we do it because we choose to. We want to do it, are passionate about it, perhaps even need to do it.And that’s the addiction, we’d probably do it for free (which ain’t a great bargaining position when you’re trying to negotiate a pay rise, let me tell ya…).So, in conclusion, what’s it like being in an archaeologist and being in a band? Its pretty much the same to be perfectly honest. That could just be me though, who knows…You do spend an awful lot of time in pubs for both though…See ya from the stage (or the bottom of a trench).Steve(Original blog post here: http://fromtheashesband.com/blog-day-of-archaeology)The Steve White: Archaeologists Rock! by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"564","Cows, Cropmarks and a CursusView of Lochbrow, looking west from the cursus terminal (photo ©Kirsty Millican)It is the kind of place most people would pass by without a second glance, an apparently empty field usually occupied only by cows, but the site of Lochbrow in Dumfries and Galloway is one of my favourite archaeological sites inScotland. My name is Kirsty Millican and I am a Historic Land-Use Assessment (HLA) Officer at RCAHMS. My interests, though, extend beyond HLA to encompass cropmark archaeology and the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age periods in Scotland. Lochbrow is a site I first encountered while undertaking research for my PhD and is a place that I have returned to several times since.So why do I find such an apparently unremarkable location interesting? Because of the cropmarks of course! Cropmarks are formed by the differential growth of crops over buried archaeology, and are best recorded from the air. A scattering of such marks were first recorded at Lochbrow by an RCAHMS aerial survey in 1992, indicating the buried presence of pits and ditches. These features can be interpreted as a timber cursus monument (a long enclosure defined by timber posts usually dating to the Earlier Neolithic), at least one, if not two, timber circles (a monument form dating from the Later Neolithic into the Bronze Age) and several round barrows (later prehistoric monuments). This tells us that this apparently empty field was an important location for a long period of time, and was probably a hive of activity during the construction and use of these monuments.Map of the cropmarks (in red) and the main topographic features at Lochbrow. The cursus is the long enclosure oriented north to south, the two timber circles lie to the east and south-west of the cursus and the barrows to the south.What I have always found remarkable is the level of information such ghostly marks in crops can reveal. This is archaeology with no remaining above-ground features; if you visit the site today there is nothing to suggest such a complex of sites ever existed. Moreover, the cursus and timber circles were built of wood, a material that is not durable and so does not survive for us to study today. All that remains are the infilled pits that were dug to take the upright timbers forming the outer boundary of these wooden monuments; it is these pits that influence the formation of the cropmarks, allowing us to photograph them from the air. The cropmarks, then, give us a rare glimpse into the activities and structures built by our prehistoric ancestors. Indeed, without the simple technique of taking photographs from an aeroplane we would know nothing about this important group of monuments, nor the location of what was undoubtedly a very special place. It makes you wonder how much more is buried beneath your feet …!So why have I chosen to visit this site several times, if there is nothing to see of this archaeology on the ground? Well, sites such as these are not built independently of their location, and you can learn a lot about a site by considering their locations, even without above-ground archaeology. Indeed, I believe that the sites at Lochbrow are closely connected with their location, and the cursus in particular seems to mimic the dominant topography. By visiting the site of these cropmarks, I’ve been able to suggest that the topography of this location was likely drawn into the use and functioning of these monuments, possibly defining the outer extents of this place, and may have had an influence upon the form of the monuments chosen to be built here. I have also returned twice (with colleagues from Edinburgh and York Universities) to undertake geophysical and topographic surveys of this site, to try to gain a better understanding of the sites here and their location, and to investigate the possibility of additional sites and features that have not been recorded by the cropmarks. The results so far are promising and I’ll be returning again later this year to finish the surveys. Who knows what we’ll find, but I’m excited by the notion that so much lies buried beneath my feet, and with a little perseverance we may be able to add a little bit more to the story of this site and to our understanding of what people did here and the structures they built thousands of years ago.Undertaking geophysical survey at Lochbrow (photo ©Gordon Wallace)To view more about these cropmarks, visit the RCAHMS Canmore page for this site with particular reference to the cursus and pit enclosureThe Kirsty Millican HLA Officer RCAHMS by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Included are perspective drawings, excavation drawings and photographs, site reports and notebooks, context cards, small finds cards and correspondence, as well as the latest digital technologies like laser scanning and 3D models.Some of the oldest material comes from the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Collection with records by antiquarians like James Skene of Rubislaw, James Drummond and Sir Henry Dryden, as well as early excavation photographs of Roman forts at Newstead, Mumrills and Ardoch and brochs by Sir Francis Tress Barry. Other material includes historic prints and negatives by photographers such as John Patrick, Erskine Beveridge and James Ritchie, as well as early excavation photographs by the Office of Works and the Scottish Development Department.Other noteworthy collections include material from the excavations by Vere Gordon Childe; watercolour drawings by John Nicolson; surveys of stone circles by Professor Alexander Thom and the research archive of Brian Hope-Taylor. RCAHMS is also the main repository in Scotland for all documentary archives from modern archaeological survey and excavations and holds large quantities of material from archaeological units and projects funded by Historic Scotland.One of the largest components of the archaeological archive is made up of records created by RCAHMS from its creation in 1908 until the present day. From the earliest notebooks and sketches, to the drawings for the county Inventories, and the latest laser scans, the collection illustrates thousands of monuments across Scotland and how recording techniques have changed through the decades.The collection continues to grow on a daily basis as our specialist survey staff traverse the country to investigate and record Scotland’s archaeological sites and landscapes, using photography, measured drawings and digital technology.All the collections can be consulted in our Search Room or by using our online resources.

"572","1. TravelEver since my parents took me on a trip to the Caribbean as a child, I plotted to find a way to spend every winter in the tropics. I wanted to get paid to travel. I wanted to escape the Chicago snow.My chance came in grad school when I had the opportunity to teach field schools in Belize. I was in grad school for a long time so I was able to look forward to flying south with the birds each time spring semester rolled around.Since completing my MA and PhD in Archaeology I’ve continued living a nomadic life by working on projects in Mexico, California, and Arizona. What I didn’t expect was that I’d eventually tire of travel after moving from motel to motel off remote desert highways as a CRM archaeologist. So now I’m what they call an armchair archaeologist, and today I’m exploring world archaeology via posts to this blog.2. AdventureTropical archaeology isn’t for the faint-hearted. Oh, no. I knew an archaeologist who was struck down by lightning and another friend who was mauled to death by a jaguar. Never underestimate the Maya gods!I once accidently walked right into a military jungle camp and caught the sleeping soldiers off-guard in their hammocks. I overcame my greatest fears when I swam through a cave so dark I couldn’t see my hand an inch away from my nose. I’ve surveyed a bombing range littered with undetonated WWII ordinance under a blistering desert sun. I used to need a canoe and rappelling gear to get to work.These days my adventures are a bit tamer with less chance of malaria or blowing up. But I wouldn’t trade those memories for anything. The Good Ol’ Days: Rappelling to Work in a Maya Cave 3. CuriosityI doubt I’ll ever quench my insatiable thirst for knowledge. Whether I’m puzzling over a database in the lab or trying to reconstruct a prehistoric crime scene in the field, the process of figuring out what happened in the past drives me.When I’m done posting this blog, I’m going to go excavate my desk to figure out where my favorite moleskine notebook has disappeared to. It contains all those burning questions that keep me up at night. 4. Fame and RichesThat couldn’t be further from the truth! Archaeology isn’t as glamorous as it appears in the movies. Most of us do it for the love of the past, not for the glory. I’ve published over 17 years of scholarly journal articles, book chapters, and web articles and haven’t received a single dime for them. If you’re in it for the money, or to be revered by society for analyzing dead people’s garbage, then this probably isn’t the field for you. If you’re seeking to find buried treasure and live large off the illicit antiquities market, then may a giant boulder steamroll you Indiana Jones-style. 5. OutreachThat’s exactly what I’m doing today, for my bread and butter, and as I type these words. In creating digital curriculum for a virtual university and contributing to educational resources on the interwebs, I’m sharing my passion for old, dead things with you, the interested public.I’ll never forget the moment I first found a pottery jar in a hard-to-reach niche of a remote cave. It probably hadn’t been seen in a thousand years. That feeling—the thrill of discovery—motivates me to educate the public about why it’s important to protect artifacts and archaeological sites for future generations to treasure and explore. Dr. Polly, EduPunk and Cyber ArchaeologistThe 5 Reasons Why I Became an Archaeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"573","The work of a conservator can be really varied and we never quite know what we’ll be asked to work on from one day to the next. At Wiltshire Conservation Service, one of the projects we are working on with Foundations Archaeology and the BMI Bath Clinic on is the treatment of five burial urns dating back to the Roman conquest. These were found at the site of Linden Homes’ King Harry Lane development in St Albans.Archaeologists have determined that the site King Harry Lane, was of significant importance. The cremation urns were found at a burial ground, located at the entrance to a late Iron Age ‘oppidum’ or defended settlement . St Albans, known as Verulamium, was a key site in the Roman period and as such, these cremation urns, along with the other archaeology on the site, are seen to be nationally important.Before we started excavating the BMI Bath Clinic has kindly scanned the urns, using their CT scanner. From this we were able to see the extent of the cremated material inside and also that one of the urns also contains a small metal object. We have been excavating the urns on a microscopic scale, detailing the contents and making them stable. Click on the link below to see the scan.CT scan of Cremation Urn from King Harry LaneOnce the cremations have been removed from the urns, the bones will be cleaned and dried under laboratory conditions. The information gathered from this micro-excavation will then be sent to the archaeologists who will be able to interpret the evidence alongside the archaeology already discovered.

"574","The Early Bronze Age pottery from the cemetery in the Mound of the Hostages at Tara, Co. Meath. From O’Sullivan 2005. About meI am a professional archaeologist who lives and works in Ireland. Part of my professional work involves overseeing the archaeological programme of Bord na Móna, where I act as Project Archaeologist. Bord na Móna is the commercial Semi-state body with responsibility for the development of the Irish national peat resource. Bord na Móna owns and manages more than 80,000 ha of land spread across Ireland. Most of this is peatland which has preserved a wealth of organic archaeological and palaeoenvironmental material. I also act as Project Archaeologist for the Irish Concrete Federation where I am responsible for implementing the Archaeological Code of Practice which was agreed with government in 2002. But on this particular day I am spending my time working on my own archaeological research.ResearchI have been involved in research on the Irish Bronze Age for more than twenty years and carried out my Masters and  Doctoral research on the period. Since then I published extensively on the burials, monuments and artefacts of the period. For the last number of years I have been collecting, collating and digesting the many hundreds of reports of Bronze Age sites excavated in Ireland that have been generated during the last decade of development-led archaeology. For example more than 600 Bronze Age houses are now known from Ireland and for the first time a substantial village has been found. In this work I have been greatly aided by the willingness of my colleagues to discuss their excavations and even provide copies of unpublished reports. New discussion groups like UCD Experimental Archaeology  and Togher: Irish Raised Bog Archaeology have also proved to be very positive spaces for discussing finds, sites and ideas. As well as this the National Roads Authority, The Heritage Council and Eachtra Archaeological Projects have set a sterling example by publishing reports on line. For the last six months I have been working through my notes and turning them into a book with the working title: Ireland in the Bronze Age. My objective is to produce the first synthetic work that covers the entire period of metal use in Ireland from the introduction of copper to the transition to Iron at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Bronze Age  healthToday I am concentrating on the evidence of human health from Early Bronze Age cemeteries. The evidence from cemeteries where there is adequately preserved skeletal material, and these remains have been analysed for pathology, indicates that there was widespread iron-deficiency anaemia amongst the population, both children and adults. These deficiencies present as porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia and dental hypoplasia. Instances have been found to date in a dozen cemeteries in Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. Usually these diseases are interpreted as indicating a population that was poorly adapted to its environment or was under nutritional stress. Bronze Age agricultureHowever, today the areas in which these cemeteries are found are amongst the most fertile regions of Ireland and the fields surrounding these cemeteries, if not built on, are used to fatten cattle and grow cereals. When I look at the archaeological and palynological evidence for agriculture it indicates that Early Bronze Age farming was generally small scale and carried out in the lowlands in clearings in the forest close to water that were restricted to the lighter and better drained lowland soils (Weir 1995). In the preceding Neolithic period people had tended to clear farmland in upland areas and so in the Early Bronze Age people were moving into a new area of the landscape. These clearings were laboriously made by hand to provide grazing land for cattle and pigs with some sheep and horses. There was some cereal cultivation of both wheat and barley but this appears to have been on a limited scale although preserved wheat and barley has been found at a number of sites. The resources of the forest were also used and hazel nuts, wild apples and berries were collected. The farmers also hunted and the remains of red deer, wild boar and hare have been found at settlements.The pollen evidence indicates a gradual clearance of forest surrounding the settlements. For example at Roughan Hill, Co. Clare a system of irregularly-shaped fields enclosed by stone walls was laboriously cleared from the forest and contained dispersed houses within enclosures and family tombs covering an area of about 144 hectares (Jones 1998). An area this size might have produced 200-300 cattle annually as well as some cereals and there were all the resources of the surrounding woodlands. Settlements of the period were usually small scale consisting of just one or two houses for perhaps a single family group. The skeletal remains of the farmers tell the story of the hard work of cutting down trees, removing stones from fields and building stone walls. Many people suffered from injured backs with Schmorl’s nodes, periostitis, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis. The archaeological evidence suggests that the Early Bronze Age people were quite well adapted to their environment and don’t appear to have been outstripping the available resources. So I am not happy with widespread nutritional stress as an explanation for the anaemia. PathogensAn alternative explanation is that a low level of iron in the blood may be a defence against pathogens. During infection iron is sequestered in the liver, which prevents invading pathogens from getting adequate supplies of this vital element. If these people were being affected by a pathogen it would have to be one that could spread to small-scale low-density communities living close to rivers, lakes and bogs. Diseases like Typhus require a higher density of settlement to spread, however mosquito-borne pathogens are a possibility. For example recent investigations of Egyptian Royal mummies have identified the DNA of Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria parasite, in association with  porotic hyperostosi (Nerlich  et al. 2008)Although Ireland no longer has any mosquito-borne pathogens, it did in the past. Irish mosquitoes are known to have spread tertian malaria and the last major outbreak occurred in Cork in the 1840s, 50s and 60s. Mosquitoes also have the potential to spread yellow fever, dengue fever and encephalitic viruses. Today Ireland has 18 species of mosquitoes of which four are Anopheles, potential carriers of the plasmodium vivax protozoan that causes malaria. Although mosquitoes have not been recorded in archaeological or palaeoenvironmental samples they occur throughout Europe and were first scientifically recorded in Ireland in 1823 (Ashe et al. 1991). During the Early Bronze Bronze Age the climate is thought to have been 1-2° warmer than today and provided a satisfactory environment for mosquitoes to breed.So an alternative hypothesis to the suggestion that all the iron-deficiency anaemia seen in Early Bronze Age remains is caused by nutritional deficiency could be the presence of a  pathogen or pathogens, that triggered the anaemic reaction as a defence mechanism.  In this scenario the movement of people into lowland areas close to water and the opening up of the forest canopy altered the ecology and provided new habitats for mosquitos to colonise. The increased populations of mosquitoes bred in close proximity to humans and spread pathogens that resulted in the anaemic reaction. Although there is currently no direct evidence for mosquito-borne pathogens in Bronze Age Ireland I think this is a useful hypothesis that is worth further consideration and testing. ReferencesAshe, P., O’Connor, J.P. and Casey R.J. 1991.

"575","Ok, my first ever participation at the Day of Archaeology, so maybe I should introduce what I am doing as an archaeologist first.Maybe I am an example of a not-so-very-typical archaeologist – at least in my current project. I am a Prehistorian, specialized in landscape archaeology and the Early Iron Age in Middle Europe but at the moment I am leading a large European project. ArchaeoLandscapes Europe (http://www.archaeolandscapes.eu) is dealing with existing inequalities in the use and expertise of various remote sensing methods and techniques in Europe, including Aerial Archaeology, Satellite Imagery, LiDAR/Airborne Laserscanning and Geophysics (though some might argue that Geophysics is not that much ‘remote’).We organise conferences, meetings, field schools, aerial archaeology training schools, workshops and exchange visits/internships, we publish books, articles, guides and manuals and we are planning an travelling exhibition (starting in Dublin next year). Being funded by the EU Culture 2007-2013 programme we not only aim for archaeologists as a target group but also for the laymen, to raise the awareness of new technologies in and for archaeology, embedded in dealing with the overall European Cultural Heritage.My responsibility is the management of the project, the communication with the ‘outside world’ and amongst our 57 partners (at present) from all over Europe and Australia. So coming form the field of landscape archaeology and having been involved with a lot of work with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) I am used to this kind of computer based work, but the difference now is the lack of archaeological research. Instead of this I deal with communication mainly, organising meetings, deal with EU financial rules (least-cost path analyses are easy compared to this!), handle grant applications and try to herd cats (i.e. 57 very different partner institutions).My home institution is the Roman-Germanic Commission of the German Archaeological Institute, based in Frankfurt, Germany. The support of such a large institution is essential for a work like this, so it’s a burden that is loaded on many shoulders!The downside of my job clearly is the lack of research work, the advantage definitely is the communication with so many different people with different cultural, educational, scientific and personal background. It is exciting to meet them and to make new experiences and to learn a lot on the many travels that I have to make.So, no shovel, no trowel, no fancy GIS algorithms, but lots of emails, meetings and great evenings, spent with interesting people – archaeology is so diverse, that is what hopefully Day of Archaeology will show!Oh, in case anyone wonders about the “half day” in the title: It’s Friday and many people leave for the weekend after lunch – and I will leave my office for holidays then  :-)But I hope to find the time to post some more today … Feel free to blame any typos on the automatic spell-checker – or on the fact that I am German  :-)The Half a Day in the Life of an Archaeologist by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"576","Morning in York. A new day. A day doing archaeology. Not that many would recognise it as archaeology. I’ll be going through a pile of references on engaging young people in archaeology to help complete a report for the CBA. Do most archaeologists spend most of their time digging? No! We spend most of our time reading.Just read on the BBC News website that some pot sherds from Xianrendong in China have been dated to 20,000 BP. The oldest pottery yet discovered. That puts British Neolithic pots into perspective.Also just received a nice photo of an Acheulian hand-axe from Prof. Bae in Korea to help illustrate an article I’ve written for the Young Archaeologist magazine. The hand-axes at the Jeongok-ri site are made of quartzite. It’s very hard and tough to knap – I tried when I was out there last month. I have my poor attempt at a my very own hand-axe on my desk as a paperweight.The A New Day by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"577","First off I should say that I always find it quite uneasy calling myself an Illustrator. To me illustrator conjurs up images of amazing artefact and reconstruction drawings; I am not one of those, I deal with plans, sections, maps using CAD, GIS and Adobe Illustrator, as well as carrying out graphic design and web design.Today I have three main tasks to deal with:1. Carry out edits to the illustrations for a site that AOC excavated a while ago, and is now ready to be published.2. Finish designing a pair of interpretation boards that will eventually be placed by a Neolithic cairn.3. Produce some maps using GIS for our York office so that they have them ready for carrying out a heritage assessmentOn top of this I normally have lots of small tasks given to me over the course of a working day. These can be to place a news item on our website and then tweet a link to all of our followers, to design & produce a trenching plan for evaluations, to edit/enhance photographs, to PDF documents ready to be sent to clients (my machine is one of the few capable of producing PDFs) and so on.7:15 I’m in the office, cup of tea made as the computer boots up and logs in. Straight away there’s an email asking me to produce some plates for an HBR report. A small job that will only take 10-15 minutes.

"580","My name is The Cog. I’m a medieval shipwreck. Found in 2000 during construction works in the harbor of Antwerp (Belgium). A dendrochronologist was able to date my wood. He told me it was chopped in the winter of 1325-1326. Somewhere in the northwest of Germany.This is how I was found in the Deurganckdok (Antwerp) in 2000. (Copyright ADW)Since my discovery I just can’t stop talking. But what did you expect? I was lying there, under a sedimentary layer of 7 metres, for several centuries. Nobody to share my thoughts or feelings with. Doomed to pass my days in solitude. Until this huge crane brought me light in the darkness – and unfortunately also a stabbing pain in my hull.The age-long pressure of the sediment on my timbers caused an annoying selective amnesia. I don’t remember where I come from. Who built me and which waterways I may have sailed. But what fascinates me most is the strange position I was found in. Upside down. Without any remains of a possible cargo or mast. How did this happen? Did I founder in a violent storm or a devastating deluge? Or was I already put on inactive for a while?Colleagues from the Flanders Heritage Agency registrating my wood with the FARO-arm. (Copyright Kris Vandevorst)I was lucky to find some interested experts who wanted to help me out. During my research project, carried out by the Flanders Heritage Agency, I discover new truths about my past. Together with the broad public. Because that is what I do: I involve the public in a direct and personal way and I try to make the output of my research more accessible. Let’s be honest. What is more attractive for a non-scientific public: live updates through social media with pictures and results hot from the press or a well-considered written final report with the main scientific results and conclusions?A ‘fait divers’ or an important discovery in my research. By blogging, tweeting (@dekogge) and facebooking, I launch my story for those who wish to follow it. Day in day out, I wear my heart on my sleeve (or should I say timber?).

"581","Today I am working on some of the history of the site. Research can take many forms and for this project I am utilizing historic records that are known for the area. These include registered maps, known local Aboriginal sites, notes taken from books relating to Bibra Lake and its Pioneering families as well as personal photographs from descendants.Research for Tappers HomesteadThe research of any site is integral to understanding its location and position within the landscape and its importance as a locus within the neighborhood or community. The Tapper family homestead was a focal point of the Bibra Lake  community during its later years.Documentation and information  is sourced from local libraries, the State Library of Western Australia, the City of Cockburn council,  the Azelia Ley Museum, interviews with descendants which includes viewing family photographs, Landgate (Government Department dealing with land titles and records for Western Australia), and personal communication from the period that is stored at the Battye Library in Perth.Tying the history and the archaeology together can be challenging at times, yet when it all falls into place, and you hit that “Eureka!” moment, nothing can compare! Archaeology can also show discrepancies that may exist in the historical record too. After being informed there was ever only one structure on the site, I was a bit perplexed as to why I had two distinctive artefact scatter areas. The research has since shown that there were actually three structures, which was confirmed by early aerial photography, and now know that the three structures belonged to Mary-Ann Tapper, her son Daniel Tapper, and daughter Florence Korten. This information has answered one of my research questions relating to the artefact scatters.I was only permitted to collect artefacts that were visible on the ground. With over 400 artefacts collected from an area of 60m x 70m, after it had been churned up by trench digging for reticulation pipes, I should gain some insight into the daily lives of the three households. With the last property being demolished in the 1960′s the date range of the artefacts (1895-1960′s) is challenging but rewarding – another aspect to the research of the site is obtaining dates or date ranges for each individual artefact, once they have all been placed in a database. There has been major disturbance to the area and so I will not be able to ascertain which artefacts came from which household, yet should gain an overall picture as to the standard of living of the Tapper family.There are still many hours of work to do to unravel the history of the site – at least another couple of months before a report can be written for the local council. Archaeology work is not just digging – there is so much more to do. I field walked for one and a half days only, and will spend approximately 3-4 months researching and formulating a report, but this is what I love about the discipline – variety, investigation and knowledge – I wouldn’t have it any other way!The Tappers Homestead, Bibra Lake, Western Australia. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"582","Although I plan to be on holiday on 29th June this year I really wanted to contribute to Day of Archaeology this year. So this is a day in the life of a Heritage Information Partnerships Supervisor! First a bit of background…My name is Sarah MacLean and I work at English Heritage in the Heritage Data Management Team. My role is to act as a liaison between English Heritage and Historic Environment Records (HERs) staff.A HIP Supervisor at workHERs are databases that hold information about known archaeology, historic buildings and other historic sites for the area they cover. They can cover single local authority areas, multiple local authority areas, whole counties or a national park. They were originally set up to provide data to inform the planning process. Now they also provide information to researchers and local communities about the history of their area. You can find out more about which HER covers your local area and how to access their information on the Heritage Gateway.We support the development of HERs through advice, guidance and partnership working. We promote the adoption of standards and good practice. There are over 80 HERs that we support in England.I have previously worked as a HER Officer which gives me a useful insight into that world. HERs are a fantastic information management tool in archaeology and can be used for a whole host of purposes. From advising the planning process, to academic research, to plain curiosity of what is down your street. I have always been interested in sharing knowledge and information management. With a passion for archaeology working with HERs has always seemed like a natural career path for me.A typical day for me starts around 8:30am. I check my e-mails and look at my plan for the day. I’ve usually planned my day before I finish the previous day. However there is always the possibility an e-mail has arrived in the interim to change my mind!I have a couple of small tasks to do first. I am one of the people responsible for making minor edits on the Heritage Gateway website. I have to update a couple of the contact pages for the HERs. We try to keep these up to date and we rely on HER officers to provide us with this information.At the moment I’m writing a report on the 2012 Content and Computing Survey. We run this survey every 3-4 years to see how English HERs have changed. We ask a range of questions about the types of sites they record, what database package they use and which data standards they adhere to. This year we have run the survey online for the first time. We have had a fantastic response with 87% of HERs completing the survey. It is important for us to make sure we feed the information back to HERs to help them with their forward planning. The report won’t be completely finished until the autumn but I want to make a good start. I spend most of my morning working on the section about data standards and thesauri. We encourage HERs to try and use the same terminology across the country. The good news is that all the respondents use the national monument thesaurus. This means that if you are looking for a specific type of site e.g. pillbox, it doesn’t matter whether you are in Northumberland or Cornwall the pillbox records should all be indexed as ‘pillbox’.Just before lunch I finish pulling together information I need for an upcoming meeting. I am involved with ‘Informing the Future of the Past’. This is a set of guidelines written for HERs to use across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A number of organisations have collaborated to produce these guidelines and a number of HER officers have provided useful, illustrative case studies. At the moment the guidelines are being moved on to a new wiki format website to make them easier to update. At the steering group meeting we will be discussing the progress of this project.After lunch I get to work on another large task. One of the main pieces of work we do throughout the year is HER audits. We encourage HERs to undertake a self audit to identify areas of improvement and create a forward plan of work. HERs are also encouraged to review their audits every 3-5 years. We provide the specification for the audit and a small grant towards the cost of the work. We monitor the progress of the audit and read and respond to the finished report. Many HERs who have undertaken this work have found it beneficial.This year I am looking after four audits. Three of these have already started and this afternoon I have a monitoring meeting with one of them. The meeting is conducted by telephone and the HER Officer has provided a current draft in advance for me to check on their progress. The meeting goes well, the audit is on time and the report is looking good. I really enjoy this part of my job. I like to encourage people and help them with their work.After my meeting I check my e-mails to see that I have had a couple of queries in. I regularly receive queries from HER staff. No two are ever the same. Sometimes they are seeking guidance for a specific situation they find themselves in. Sometimes they are trying to find out who they need to contact within English Heritage for further information about the projects we run.At this time of the year we also get queries relating to our twice yearly HER Forum. The HER Forum meetings are held in summer and winter, currently in Birmingham. Presentations are given at the Forum meeting and HER staff have a chance to network during the breaks. It provides a fantastic opportunity for them to hear what other HERs are doing. Although they meet regularly at a regional level, the national meeting is sometimes the only chance to meet HER officers outside their region. This summer our theme is Local Engagement. We have some exciting talks lined up. I’m looking forward to the meeting as I’m very interested in Local Engagement. I also can’t wait to catch up with some of the HER Officers I haven’t seen for a while. There is even a possibility people will be tweeting from the meeting this year so keep an eye out for that!After another busy day, it’s time to catch my train home. Some days I do feel that I’m another step removed from the archaeology itself, but I really enjoy my work. I feel I can make a difference, if only a small one, to ensuring our past is recorded and available to all.The A Day in the Life of a Heritage Information Partnerships Supervisor by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"583","Sydney Observatory, Fort Phillip, the missing Greenway magazine and WindmillsFort Phillip used to send signals in the early 1800s.Since the flag mast was reinstated in 2007, a flag decoder permits visitors to determine the daily astronomical, shipping, meteorological and ceremonial flags flown on Sydney’s highest hill in the CBD.The significant heritage value of Sydney Observatory 1858 including the remains of Fort Phillip 1804 have been officially recognised at both local and state levels. The care and use of the site must protect the values that make it a significant part of the heritage of Sydney and NSW. The exceptional heritage aspects of the Sydney Observatory have been outlined in a ‘statement of significance’ in the Conservation Plan (Kerr). The statement forms a succinct summation of the particularly unique and significant aspects of the site and its values, and is used to guide decisions regarding the care of the site:‘The Observatory is of exceptional significance in terms of European culture. Its dominant location beside and above the port town and, later, City of Sydney made it the site for a range of changing uses, all of which were important to, and reflected, stages in the development of the colony. These uses included: milling (the first windmill); defence (the first, and still extant, fort fabric); communications (the flagstaffs, first semaphore and first electric telegraph connection); astronomy, meteorology and time keeping ;The surviving structures, both above and below ground, are themselves physical documentary evidence of 195 years changes of use, technical development and ways of living. As such they are a continuing resource for investigation and public interpretation;The place has an association with an extensive array of historical figures most of whom have helped shape its fabric. These include: colonial Governors Hunter, Bligh, Macquarie & Denison; military officers and engineers Macarthur; Barrallier; Bellasis and Minchin; convicts: the as yet unnamed constructors of the mill and fort; architects: Greenway (also a convict), Lewis, Blacket, Weaver, Dawson and Barnet; signallers and telegraphists such as Jones and the family Moffitt; astronomers: particularly PP King, Scott, Smalley, Russell, Cooke and Wood;The elevation of the site, with its harbour and city views and vistas framed by mature Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) trees of the surrounding park, make it one of the most pleasant and spectacular locations in Sydney;The picturesque Italianate character and stylistic interest of the Observatory and residence building, together with the high level of competence of the masonry (brick and stone) of all major structures on the site, combine to create a precinct of unusual quality;Finally, the continued use of the observatory for astronomical observations and the survival of astronomical instruments, equipment and some early furniture, although temporarily dispersed, and the retention of most interior spaces, joinery, plasterwork, fireplaces, and supports ensure that the observatory can remain the most intact and longest serving early scientific building in the State (Kerr 1991: 39)Also of significance for relationship of Commonwealth and State powers. Site of the first inter-colonial conference on meteorology and astronomy. (Pearson et al 1999)An excellent example of a Colonial building erected for scientific purposes and continuing to perform its function at the present time. The structure makes an imposing composition atop the historic hill originally known as Flagstaff Hill and occupies the historic Fort Phillip site (1804-45). Designed by the colonial architect Alexander Dawson and built in 1858.After completion of recent restoration from 2008  to 2011 the remains of Fort Phillip are now used for Australian historical archaeology workshops. Two of which are being set up today, June 29 for the school holiday period commencing tomorrow. They are Time Detectives and Dig It! Both workshops are being used as school holiday programs with the intent to run them on a regular basis for school and community tours.Dig it! Archaeologists in training workshops run several times each holiday period and last just under two hours. They are always sold out and we use the following ad online and in our collateral:“Become a hands-on archaeological detective and investigate the history of Fort Phillip and the site of Sydney Observatory. Experience a simulated archaeology dig, find out what happens to artefacts after they are ‘dug’ out of the ground. In wet weather, the dig is replaced by a fabulous 3-D Space Theatre session. Suitable for: ages 6–10 years”Budding young archaeologists learning the trade in the Signal Master’s Cottage atop Fort Phillip. More “Dig It!” archaeologists with one of our very own archaeologists, Anthea.Our second workshop is Time detectives: a science and archaeology game. “Treat your child to a fabulous day of science investigation at historic Fort Phillip, part of Sydney Observatory. This workshop includes a simulated archaeology dig, investigating finds, making an electronics analysis device which they then use to solve a mystery dating back 200 years. Participants get to view through binoculars and telescopes and experience the 3-D Space Theatre. Suitable for: ages 8–12 years.” This workshop lasts 6.5 hours and again is always sold out.The third archaeology program is offered to Vacation Care groups. In a typical 2 week holiday period we may have up to 10 groups attend and it is this one we have been preparing today in particular by cleaning the “dig pit” and planting our artifacts. Vacation care groups: dig it! And map it! “A fun, hands-on simulated archaeology dig. In the program for primary and infants school age children participants dress up and take part in a simulated dig with our resident archaeologist and record their findings. Binoculars are used to view South Head and the children decode Sydney Observatory flags. For high school children measurement is made using instruments and participants map a section of the site, recording their archaeology finds. Participants safely view the Sun through a telescope (weather permitting) and record their measurements of solar activity. This workshop caters for up to 60 children at a time and is suitable for ages 5–9 years and 10–14 years.As we continue to develop our programs and target schools and community groups it is expected that archaeology will continue to expand at Sydney Observatory. Work on Fort Phillip commenced in 1804 but ceased in 1806. Sydney Observatory and Fort Phillip ground plan circa 1870s.

"584","I’m a Conservation Specialist for the UCLA/Getty Conservation Program, a graduate conservation training program specializing in the conservation of archaeological and ethnographic materials.  In our 3 year course, we train students in the methods and techniques used for the examination and preservation of objects and have them understand the properties of materials, how they deteriorate and ways to slow down or prevent further deterioration.In a typical day our students attend lectures in the morning on various aspects of conservation and then follow that in the afternoon with work in the lab.  We just had an intake of a new class in the Fall of 2011 and they spent their first year learning about and working on materials such as archaeological ceramics, glass, metals, and  textiles.In one course they learned about the deterioration of archaeological ceramics and the damage caused by soluble salts. Students then determined how to identify the salts and remove them. Here a student is taking a conductivity reading of wash water as she desalinates a small ceramic vessel.In the spring quarter students had the opportunity to learn about the conservation of archaeological textiles. They were able to examine a group pre-Columbian and Coptic textiles to understand the weaving technologies and dyes used to make them. They then learned techniques to repair and wash the textiles.They also learned about the materials and techniques used to make ancient murals and tried their hand at making their own.In addition to focusing on the conservation of objects in the lab, we also try to teach the students techniques they will need to conserve material in the field.  This spring we held a mock excavation and buried several wall painting replicas that the students had to excavate (you can read more about that here).  Once they were excavated and lifted, the students brought the wall paintings back to the lab where they continued cleaning them, determining the extent of deterioration and proposing a conservation treatment.Here students brush off the soil from the very fragile surface of a wall painting replica. The paint was flaking off the surface and the mural seemed to show signs of salt damage. Students conducted a series of microchemical tests to identify the salts and then proposed methods to remove them and conserve the flaking paint.By providing training on both objects in a museum collection and in the field, we are preparing our students for whatever conditions they may encounter archaeological artifacts in.  We also encourage our students to go on archaeological excavations during the summers and internship periods to build on the fundamentals they learned during their courses. With the holistic approach to conservation that our curriculum takes, we are setting them on the path to becoming successful archaeological conservators.If you are interested in becoming a conservator or want to know more about conservation, check out the American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works for more information.  They also have a page with information on how to become a conservator.

"585","Hello! For me, the day of archaeology will be a day of interpreting geophysical data which I collected earlier. I’ll start off with a coffee and fire up my computer. I will have to spend the day behind my computer rummaging around with my GPR- and magnetometry-data. Looking through my eyelashes, trying different colourmaps, data-filters, studying other available information just to see if geophysics will reveal certain lines, shapes and anomalies in general.Conducting geophysical surveys for a commercial firm in Holland is what I do. Officially educated as an geologist/geochemist, I spend a lot of years in the environmental engineering field (soil surveys, soil remediation), but the combination of geophysics & archaeology was always appealing to me. At our firm Saricon, we also look for UXO’s, but my main field of interest is the world of archaeology!Then one day…. off to the field! Whether dressed in waterproof clothing & wellies, or short-sleeved with sunglasses, we have to do our survey. DependinBut before we can produce maps, we have to gather the data in a correct way. We have to decide what kind of geophysical techniques we will use, depending on the aim of the survey, local circumstances, geology, expected contrast between the anomalies and surrounding soil. What will the survey-setup look like(density grid, settings of equipment, testing ….)? And also important, we have to consider the available budget and time constraints.Apart from the equipment itself, a lot of ducttape & my leatherman are my necessary tools in the field.g on the chosen equipment and field circumstances we gather our data by foot or by quad. Here are some pictures of our fieldwork.So, once the data is collected, the post-processing and interpreting of the data starts. That’s what I’m doing today. And it is always exciting , because you never know in advance what the data will reveal. Finally found the lost ark maybe?Next step is to discuss our data and results with the archaeologist. I can show him/her nice colourful pictures and twirling 3D-models, but what do the anomalies mean? Using other forms of information will help us out. Groundtruthing (eg. coring) can be another important aspect of the job.Here you see a picture of different inner- and outer moats of a small medieval castle. Our GPR-survey was used to pinpoint interesting locations and determine the position of trenches.But also this small 3D-model revealed the position of former cloister-foundations.Well, the day is ending. I did a lot of work and am almost satisfied with the results. Just a little more finetuning and I can set up a meeting with the archaeologist and client to discuss results!

"586","I am an archaeology news junkie. I like to read about it and write about it. So, like most days, I made several forays to my twitter site (http://twitter.com/bobmuckle) to see what is happening in the world of archaeology. I  tend to make several tweets a day, mostly related to archaeology, but occasionally I will tweet about issues related to the Indigenous  Peoples of North America or human biological evolution as well.I have also been working on a column I am writing for the American Anthropological Association’s on-line “Anthropology News” . I write a monthly op/ed column called ‘Archaeology in North America’.  I just started drafting the column today and will revise and submit it tomorrow. It will appear on the Anthropology News web site sometime in July. The topic for the July column is on the emergent subfield of glacier and ice patch archaeology in North America, and the urgency to record the remains now being exposed by the rapidly melting ice and snow.Another bit of writing I did today was to draft a report on my recently completed field project in the forests of west coast of Canada. I made a separate entry to Day of Archaeology 2012 on that (Archaeology of a Japanese Camp in Western Canada).I am also drafting some syllabi for some courses I will be teaching in the Fall term. I am astutely aware that those great ideas for teaching that I have in June often translate into an enoromous workload for both the students and me in the Fall, so am trying to be cautious and reign my ideas in.  One of the courses I will be teaching is on the Indigenous Peoples of North America, and I am anxious to use my most recent book for that.

"587","My primary responsibility this time of year is to direct the excavation at Colonial Michilimackinac State Historic Park.  Fort Michilimackinac was established by the French around 1715, taken over by the British in 1761, and dismantled and moved to Mackinac Island with the establishment of Fort Mackinac in 1781.  Archaeological excavation has taken place at Michilimackinac every summer since 1959 and provided the foundation of the reconstruction of about half of this fortified fur trading outpost.  We are currently excavating a fur trader’s house.Today started, like most days, with a quick check of e-mail and the weather forecast: sunny and warm.  The crew and I met at our equipment shed, gathered our tools and supplies, and headed out to the site.  They got started and I had a brief meeting with the park manager about the possibility of regrading some of the park paths so that they direct rainwater away from our site,  which is in a low spot within the fort walls.In addition to our core paid staff of five, we have a rotating group of trained volunteers.  My next task for the day was to finish mapping some quads where they had been working, so the next volunteers could start fresh.After that it was a routine field day.  I’m digging in a sandy area, probably approaching the glacial beach the fort was built on, so I did not find much, only some fish bones, burned corn and small pieces of chinking from between the upright posts of the house.  In other areas of the excavation, the crew was finding more typical (for us) artifacts: fish bones, seed beads, broken glass and lead shot.  Most of what we find is very small, the size that might have fallen through cracks in the floorboards.  Because of this we water screen all of our deposit through window screen mesh.Elizabeth may have uncovered an additional section of the south wall trench of the house in her square.  The house was poteaux-en-terre, post in the ground, a traditional provincial French style.  The posts were placed in trenches dug into the beach sand.  The trenches were then filled with clay and rocks surrounding the posts.  These dark strips of soil with clay, rocks and sometimes charred posts make it easy to see the outline of the house in the natural sand.The other thing we did today, like every day, was talk to park visitors.  Our site is in the middle of a popular living history museum, and we talk to hundreds of people each day.  We had two motorcoach tours this morning and families throughout the day.It was warm, as predicted, but with a very nice breeze and clouds in the afternoon, so it turned out to be pleasant digging weather.The A Day at Michilimackinac by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"589","When one hears of an archaeological complex, one thinks of anthropologists and archaeologists pouring over artifacts found in the field.  One can imagine volumes of material discovered at a site that was just outside of town or even several states away.  However there is another side to any complex or museum.  There is an archive to maintain.  That is where people like me come in.I am currently interning at the Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex in Moundsville, West Virginia.  It is best known for being situated right next to the Grave Creek Mound, one of the largest mounds built by Native Americans in the U.S.  I volunteer in the Research Library where I catalog collections of personal correspondence.  Among our collections we have mountains upon mountains of papers donated to us belonging to Dr. Donald Dragoo.  These papers were donated by his widow, Christine Dragoo, so that they would remain an intact collection.  Dr. Dragoo was an archaeologist and also curator at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Museum (now known as Carnegie Museum of Natural History).  In the collection of papers are letters, reports, articles he has written, and articles and reports that others thought he would be interested in reading.  It is the museum’s desire that these be cataloged so that we may know what we have and where it is located.  I enter the documents into an Excel database and copy them to acid-free paper.  I also remove the old staples and paperclips, very carefully, since they tend to rust to the documents.  I then replace them with plastic archival clips to keep the documents together.  I also must wear gloves while handling the documents because the oil on our fingers contains acid that can speed up the deterioration process.  That is the sad truth, there is no way to prevent the process of deterioration, but one must do everything to slow it down.Someone might ask why I enjoy cataloging papers at a complex full of archaeological finds when I can be busy helping to preserve those artifacts.  I am a graduate of Ohio University in History with aspirations to continue my education through a Masters Degree in Library Science.  My dream is to work in a museum as an archivist.  Poring through papers such as letters and reports from the past is fascinating to me.  I also feel it is important to preserve even these as it helps to understand the bigger picture.  One can read these letters and understand the feelings of the people involved on a big excavation; the excitement as well as the frustration if luck runs out.  One case, for example, is the Cooks Cave excavation in the late 60s in which Dr. Dragoo was hoping to find the earliest known evidence to that date of man in North America.  At first as they were preparing and going through the first season of the dig, there was much excitement and anticipation at what they would find.  However, as time went on, they discovered that due to damage from water erosion they would not find the results that they had hoped for.  Cataloging these letters helps not only archaeologists in knowing previous archaeological events but also historians so we know what to write if and when the topic arises.The A Day in the Life of an Intern at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"590","The Bibra Lake area of Western Australia, formally known as Walliabup Lake, was first provided as land for pioneer settlers in 1843. The first settler to the area, in that same year, was Benedict von Bibra, a Fremantle carpenter, after whom the lake is now named. In the following years other settlers chose to make the lush area their home. Land around Bibra Lake was utilized for market gardening and later dairy cows in order to supply Fremantle and Perth with fresh produce and milk. It also attracted many pioneers for picnics and recreation, as well as having an established tea rooms.One of the founding families were the Tappers, prominent in Fremantle and associated with the maritime industry. After one of her sons died at sea, Mary-Ann Tapper was determined that her youngest son, Daniel, would not face the same fate and saved to purchase land at Bibra Lake. Her plan succeeded and the family established themselves with land at its south. Starting out as market gardeners, Daniel eventually included dairy cows in order to supplement the families living. Eventually the site of their homestead became the center of the local community with a petrol pump, telephone exchange and post office.The site of the Tapper homestead, which included three houses, that of Mary-Ann, her son Daniel, and her daughter, Florence Korten, was recently damaged by trenches being dug for reticulation pipes. With only the Morton Bay fig trees  at the site holding Heritage Listing, I have undertaken some rescue archaeology and am currently further researching the area in order to prepare a report for the local council. The aim is to ensure  future protection of the area as it now stands, and also for the other homestead sites around Bibra and North Lakes, (which are barely identifiable, hardly known, and disappearing fast due to lack of knowledge), as to their importance as one of the first areas settled outside of Fremantle in Western Australia.The project is unfunded, yet undertaken with a view for protecting local history and heritage that would otherwise be lost.Remains of one of the first homesteads of the pioneering settlers at Bibra LakeThe Rescuing Local Heritage, Western Australia. by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"591","Last year, I wrote a fairly general post about my life as a Roman bioarchaeologist for the Day of Archaeology – So You Want to Be a Roman Bioarchaeologist?  This year, I thought I’d write a more week-in-the-life kind of post.For many archaeologists, the summer is prime digging season, a time to get a ton of research done and data collected.  My summer is a bit more complicated this year, though.  I am not in the field, but rather am furiously finishing up a few writing projects with end-of-summer deadlines, packing and planning to move 700 miles away for a new faculty position that starts in five weeks, and leaving the house at 2:30pm every weekday to head to summer camp, where I pick up a 3-year-old who is exhausted, sticky with sunblock, and reeking of bug spray.Most of my days of archaeology this week have involved writing.  I am updating some previous work I did for the online student resources that go along with one of W.W. Norton‘s textbooks in physical anthropology.  I’ve done this contract work for a few years now, and I like getting to read the latest physical anthropology textbooks before they come out in print.  Plus, writing quiz questions is challenging because Norton likes analytical and conceptual questions, which go beyond the basic factual ones you find in most multiple choice tests.  Writing multiple choice questions that make students think is a good skill for a teacher to have, and it makes for more interesting exams for the students.  This question, for example, comes from my General Anthropology midterm from 2011:In the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Indiana Jones finds a burial chamber in Peru with seven mummies. Looking for a purported golden death mask, he unwraps the mummy of Francisco de Orellana, which quickly disintegrates.  If Indy had been a real archaeologist, he would have handled the situation differently by:a.  carefully removing the gold mask, taking it back to his university, and putting it on display in the art museum.b.  generating a research question about the mummies, gaining permission to transport them back to the United States, subjecting them to nondestructive testing to find out what’s inside, and figuring out how to preserve them for future study.c.  classifying the seven mummies into European and non-European and transporting the European ones back to Orellana’s homeland in Spain to be reburied.d.  all of the aboveI’ve also been working on book reviews this week.  Those of you still in undergrad may not know too much about book reviews for journals, but it’s a way to get noticed in a big-name journal without a peer-reviewed publication and a way to get a free book about an interesting topic.  Most importantly, of course, writing a book review means analyzing the content and giving a synopsis of the book’s relevance to the field.  I often assign book reviews to my lower-level anthropology courses so that students can get used to reading at a higher level – that is, not just reading for comprehension (that would be a book report), but reading critically.  Those of you in grad school should look around and find a way to get a couple book reviews on your CV before you graduate and go looking for a job.  Many journals will only solicit reviews from people with a PhD, but others will allow people with a BA or higher in anthropology or archaeology to review a book.Finding JoinsThe other way I spent my time this week was in entertaining and educating my 3-year-old daughter, who is quite happy to get incredibly filthy in pursuit of digging up treasure-trash, even in the 95-degree, 95%-humidity weather of central North Carolina.  One of the books she likes is called Archaeologists Dig for Clues, which is a charming book aimed at early elementary school kids, but it has some graphic novel elements to it so is very visually appealing to the preschool set as well.  I couldn’t pass up the opportunity, then, to do a bit of excavation when, on a walk the other day, my daughter pointed out some pottery fragments sticking out of the ground in the woods.  I collected as many pieces as I could, talked to her about why they were eroding out from under a tree root after a rain, and took them home.  We washed them, and she tried to find joins (I only ended up finding one).We certainly don’t go on makeshift archaeological digs each week, but we do a lot of puzzles and bury things in the sand only to dig them up again a few minutes later.  And I teach her as much about science as I can every afternoon using whatever toys she’s most into – so this week, I’ve been asking her to make hypotheses about which marble will go down the run fastest, then test those hypotheses, and she eventually arrived at the realization that the marble that has to go the longest distance will take more time.  It can be challenging to figure out how to integrate science into the daily life of a 3-year-old, but it’s a lot of fun to rediscover basic scientific principles through her eyes.So that’s what I’ve been doing this past week as a bioarchaeologist – science writing and science parenting!Kristina Killgrove researches the Romans at Gabii and interacts with the public through her blog (Powered by Osteons), her Twitter feed (@BoneGirlPhD), and her G+ page.The Writing and Parenting on My Day of Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"592","My Day of Archaeology is not in the field, or in the lab, or even at a conference.  By “everyday” I don’t mean mundane, quite far from it.  Everyday Archaeology is the way I choose to describe my experiences dabbling in the public aspect of museums.  Currently, I’m a PhD student at Michigan State University studying for exams and trying to get my dissertation proposal together, but I also work in our tiny museum shop, where my most common customers are children.  This job has been a completely new and enlightening experience, one which I feel has helped me grow as a future educator.  I’ve been thinking a lot about this question lately:  When I’m not in the field and not in the lab or in a place where there are artifacts readily available, how do I talk about archaeology in a way that gets people excited?One answer is using toys.  We have several archaeology toys in our shop—things like pyramid dig kits, replica projectile points, and storybooks.  When I get asked about these items, either how they work or if they’re real artifacts, it’s an opportunity to engage young minds and create a spark of interest in the field.  Most recently, I was asked if I knew what was inside the pyramid in one of the dig kits.  I replied that it was a surprise, because you never know exactly what you’re going to find during an excavation, and he promptly told his mother he wanted to buy it.  Sometimes parents (or grandparents) stop in to buy a souvenir for their kids, and ask about archaeology in Michigan so they can relay the information with the present later.  Projectile points and their abundance are a popular topic of conversation, because they are easily relatable artifacts for kids, who are often interested handmade things.Getting away from the books and artifacts during the day to talk to visitors, particularly children, grounds me and helps me put what I do in perspective.  I’ve been interested in the community aspect of doing archaeology since college, when I did lab analysis on a project where kids from a local school assisted in the excavation of their own neighborhood.  Archaeology should be meaningful for everyone, and I try to use my job in the Museum as a venue to excite curiosity for ways of knowing about the past.  Right now, that usually means talking to kids about toys, and at the end of the day I’m happy with my accomplishments.The Everyday Archaeology by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"593"," I created this comic to quickly and graphically sum up a near-apocraphal story in archaeology–the fraught, colonialist acquisition of The Moabite Stone, a important Iron Age inscription originating in Dhiban, Jordan. I had to change it several times, as there are several wildly different versions of the tale. It was fun to make the comic, but I wonder if I could have done a better job showing the complexity of the exchange between the local Bedouin and the artifact-hunting antiquarians. While I believe in using comics for archaeological outreach, I’m not sure that this one was much of a success, as it removes complexity from the story rather than showing there can be multiple narratives.For that, I consider this comic a failure in its current state. But I think it’s sometimes good to show the failures in visual communication as well as the successes. The The Moabite Stone – A Failure of Communication by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"594","I depart Friday (June 29th) to begin my dissertation fieldwork in northeastern Botswana – at last! I will be running my own archaeological fieldwork project for the first time and it has been a long road to prepare for this. From deciding where I want to work, what I want to work on, to formulating actual research questions, to applying for funding, it often seems like I’ve done nothing for the past several years but work towards this goal. I was thrilled to receive a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation to support my project, and I thought that securing funding was the last major step in the process. Boy was I wrong! Even though I wrote extensively in my funding proposal about how I would get the project done, the last several months has been all about finalizing those logistics – how will I get around in Botswana? Who will join my crew and how will I hire them? What will we eat? How in the world will I get all the necessary excavation equipment overseas? Eight years into my graduate program, and I am still working out how research “gets done.”I still wouldn’t have the answer to many of these questions if it weren’t for the many colleagues, faculty and friends whom I’ve had the wonderful luck to meet and know over the course of my graduate career. The best decision I made about my PhD work was simply to go to Botswana in 2008, at the point when I decided to look into switching from European to African archaeology. I didn’t know a soul on the African continent, I was alone, and I didn’t have a clue as to how to proceed towards finding a dissertation topic, but I went anyway. If I hadn’t, I would not have ever been able to develop a successful research plan. I didn’t go completely unarmed, however – my dissertation advisor has worked in Botswana for decades and he gave me a starting point for whom to contact, as well as a name to drop.I didn’t fly home in 2008 with a well-developed project, only some ideas, a sense of how things got done on the ground there, and several people I could now contact for advice and ideas. This, however, is actually a pretty good start, because it was the start of a network. I’d initially been terrified and clueless as to how to “network”, but I tried it anyway – I just kept talking to people. Showing up at museums and conferences, listening to presentations, sending emails, asking questions. Persistence pays off in this regard: it gets less scary, and eventually people start remembering who you are (especially if you make some presentations of your own). I’ve continued to build this network since then. Every conference I go to, every paper I read, every journal I browse, I meet ideas and people, and I learn how they got it done. Most of all, I’ve been learning that there is no formula for “getting it done” – there are a myriad of opportunities, coincidences, and partnerships that can lead to a fieldwork project. There is no perfect research, only decisions made to take one fork in the road or another. There is no perfect researcher either, only people willing to take responsibility for those decisions and see them through, to make sense out of what often appears to be a chaos of dirt, rocks, numbers, messy paperwork and a grumpy crew.So I guess this post isn’t so much about archaeology per se, as it is about how to be an archaeologist (or at least my perspective on the subject). Maybe next year, when I am living in the lab trying to sort through all the artifacts from this year’s inaugural field season, I can write more about prehistory itself. I am pretty sure, however, that every archaeologist goes through some form of what I’ve described here, and hence it’s worth mentioning.If you’re interested to read more about what my project actually entails, I invite you to visit my Petridish website at http://www.petridish.org/projects/prehistoric-kalahari-desert-settlements. It’s a fund-raising website, but don’t feel like you need to contribute. I’ve got a description of what I’ll be doing in Botswana and I will keep updating the site as long as they let me. (I also like to get the word out about Petridish because it’s a great way to connect science projects with interested members of the public!)Feel free to email me at daggetta (at) msu (dot) edu if you’ve got questions about what I do or want more resources on archaeology! I will, as I mentioned, actually be in the field and therefore will not have regular access to internet for the next several months, but I will do my best.Thanks for reading!- AdrianneThe How a Research Project Happens (My Perspective) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"595","Since its creation, the  Florida Public Archaeology Network’s North Central Region office, located in Tallahassee, has worked hard to assist local organizations that are working on various preservation projects in the region. The most recent of which involves a historic African American cemetery located in Tallahassee, Florida. The Munree Cemetery, as it is known, was established in the late 1800s to early 1900s. It is associated with the Welaunee and Monreif plantations of Tallahassee. The cemetery contains at least 250 burials, the majority of which are unmarked. Since 2009 a group of concerned citizens have been working with county and city officials to protect and preserve this historic site. The citizens established a non-profit organization, The Munree Cemetery Foundation, Inc. as part of this effort. In early 2012 this group contacted the Southeast Archaeological Center asking if there were any archaeologists that would be interested in assisting them. The Southeast Archaeological Center contacted the North Central FPAN office. Since that time the Southeast Archaeological Center and the North Central FPAN office have partnered with the local citizens to work on having the cemetery properly documented. This opportunity is being used to create awareness within the community of the importance of historic cemeteries and how to properly maintain and protect them. After all, cemeteries are a non-renewable resource – once they are gone, they are gone for ever! And when a cemetery is abandoned and disappears over time, the priceless information that cemetery provides to archaeologists and historians is lost forever as well. Burials are not only a reflection of those buried there, but also of the community and the cultural practices of those that were present at the internment of those buried.On June 29th and June 30th  a team of archaeologists from both organizations and volunteers from the Munree Cemetery Foundation, Inc. will take two days to document the cemetery and conduct some much needed maintenance. The Southeast Archaeological Center is generously providing use of their GPR equipment to assist with this effort. On June 30th the volunteers and local citizens will have the opportunity to get some hands on experience using the GPR. The group will also take this opportunity to learn how to safely and properly clean cemetery monuments using D-2 Biological Solution and learn how to document sites using the Florida Master Site File cemetery form. In addition to using these more common methods of cemetery documentation, a unique opportunity has been presented. On June 29th, which happens to be the 2012 Day of Archaeology, we will utilize specially trained Human Remains Detection (HRD) canines to help identify unmarked burials. After several months of planning, three dog handlers and their specially trained dogs will be assisting in identifying the boundaries of this cemetery and will also help to identify the locations of unmarked graves. This information will be compared with the results of the GPR survey. The public is  invited out to the cemetery while the dogs and archaeologists are conducting their survey. Of course, we all will take time to answer questions and educate visitors about the importance of protecting historic cemeteries.Tomorrow we will post another blog about this project! We will also be live tweeting, look for the hash tags #Munree and #Dayofarch! The Human Remain Detection Dogs Help to Identify Unmarked Graves in an African American Cemetery by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"596","When self-employed, a year just goes like that <clicks fingers>.You may have read my Day of Archaeology blog post from last year.I have since worked in a number of cemeteries searching for unmarked graves using geophysical methods. I spoke at the Cemeteries and Crematoria Association of Victoria conference in April (my first ever conference presentation) and am in the throws of writing my first paper about some work I did over the last year.I have been undertaking geophysical surveys at the Creswick Cemetery (in Victoria, Australia) for the last year-and-a-bit, tracking down unmarked Chinese graves and an old homestead and associated features (rubbish pits, garden beds, etc.). In all this time, I have been able to test just about every geophysical method under the sun, and so am able to compare the effectiveness of certain methods at detecting certain types of archaeological features. I am hoping it will make a good read. Our data collection phase finished last week, so now it is (academic) reporting time. The client’s report has already been written and is publicly accessible for those interested.Earlier this week, I had a computer issue and lost all of my tax data. Sadly, my taxes are due today. Hence, I spent the last four days doing nothing but my tax. Needless to say, this hasn’t been a very ‘archaeological’ week. Taxes were finished and submitted late last night, thankfully.Today, though, I am driving back to Creswick, where three cemeteries nearby heard of my work and are interested in my surveying their empty land to look for any unmarked graves that may be present. Assessing each cemetery prior to providing them with a quotation will take me all of this weekend.I have also branched out into geodetic surveying (i.e. creating maps of archaeological excavations and landscapes) using GIS, RTK GPS and robotic total stations. These technologies are certainly a far cry from the days of old, when we just used measuring tapes and a compass! I’ve also been using car- and tripod-mounted laser scanners to create full-colour three-dimensional models of archaeological sites, heritage structures and cemeteries (you’d be surprised by how many people want to look at what is written on headstones in a cemetery far, far away). I’m also looking into using airborne LiDAR for a major archaeological prospection project.That’s about all for me for the year.And, for those of you wondering, the big settlement project I was getting ready for last year ended up not getting any funding, so it didn’t happen. Anyone fancy donating some cash to the project?Until next year… feel free to stalk me on my Facebook page , Twitter and my blog.Live long and prosper.The Another Day In The Life (Of An Archaeological Geophysicist) by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"597","6:00 amI wake up. My colleague who came from the Archaeological Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in Sofia is my guest these days. We drink our first cup of coffee and exchange opinions about today’s trip. We have a really busy agenda and we begin slowly to sort out and prepare all the equipment we need for the field.Prospecting St. Atanas site, Macedonia07:00 amWe are on the highway from Skopje to Eastern Macedonia. The road to the small town of Kochani takes no more than 1 hour and 15 minutes. Our colleague, archaeologist Ilinka Atanasova is already waiting for us. Together we leave Kochani towards the archaeological site of St. Atanas located a few miles from this city. The prehistoric site of Eneolithic period with outstanding findings of female figurines has been attracting the attention of the scientific community for several years, since it was prospected and excavated in 2008. But we are more focused on the chipped stone material that is my subspecialty in archaeology. While our colleague is explaining the artefacts of the site, we are observing profiles of the trenches where in the soil there are still embedded flint tools.Eneolthic figurines from the Republic of Macedonia, St. Atanas site10:30 amThe stone collection from mine OpaliteOur visit to the mine “Opalit” is scheduled before. This mine for non-metals (opal, agate, chalcedony, opalized tuffa) is located 1 km from the site of St. Atanas. Several years ago this mine was my topic of interest as a possible location where prehistoric communities of the region and beyond obtained raw material for their stone tools. The same goes for my colleague from Bulgaria, who tests the assumption that some raw materials for stone tools found at prehistoric sites along the Struma in Bulgaria came from this deposit. We walk around and observe the surface deposits in search of possible quarries made by prehistoric communities. We take photos and document the information for my doctoral dissertation.13:30 pmWe arrive at the Institute of History and Archaeology at the University of Stip, my home institution. A meeting with prof. d-r. Blazo Boev, my mentor for the thesis, is very useful. The long talk covers all my notes from today and personal opinions on the subject of local resources for stone in prehistoric Macedonia. Any information fills in and shapes my thesis towards this topic.14:45 pmDriving to the city of Vinica, our final destination for today. In a local “Terracotta Museum” there is a small collection of ground and abrasive stone tools from the archaeological site ‘Vinica Fortress’. I feel a moral and professional responsibility to help with this topic, since I’m the only archaeologist in Macedonia working with stone artefacts from prehistory. While I am getting all information about the field notes and stratigraphy, I am thinking about possibility to come again with my mentor. We could work together and process this collection for scientific publication. In the meantime we managed to visit the site ‘Vinica Fortress’, the fortification from the time of Justinian I, which is a trademark of the town of Vinica.Ground and abrasive stone tools vrom Vinica Fortress (Eneolithic)17:00We get back to Skopje. We are home and I began to check and answer emails, facebook and twitter messages. My archaeological day has not yet been completed. I need to sort all impressions, notes and photos from the past day in the folders to be usable in the future for me or for someone else.*   *   *This article was written as part of the action for ‘Day of Archaeologists’ (June 29, 2012).

"598","Part of working for the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) means that I have handled more important artefacts than the average field or museum archaeologist. I am going to try (technology permitting) to give a flavour of this today by using a relatively recent find to highlight the work we do and how one find can shed light on a much bigger picture .The Bitterley hoardThe hoard of coins was originally found in February 2011 (a long time before this day of archaeology) by a metal detector user. The hoard dates from the civil war and they have been slowly working their way through the treasure system. The find reached a crucial stage yesterday – when Mr John Ellery, HM Coroner for Shropshire, found that they constituted a case of treasure. This offical opinion is based upon hours (and weeks) of careful research by the staff of the British Museum, me and other colleagues at the PAS.Over the next few posts today I hope to show you the different facets of the PAS and Treasure. I’m hoping to do this throughout the day in small bite size chunks. I hope you enjoy the journey and this day of archaeology for 2012. Peter ReavillFinds Liaison Officer for Shropshire and HerefordshirePortable Antiquities Scheme. ps: this is me – getting my hands dirtyThe The Bitterley Hoard – An Introduction by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Image © Powerhouse Museum, all rights reserved.So I thought I’d share some insights into what it’s like working in archaeology Down Under (i.e. in Australia!) – specifically, in my role as an Assistant Curator of Design & Society at Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum and as a PhD candidate in Egyptology at Macquarie University.As a museum curator, I don’t really have a ‘typical’ day. In my position, I work quite broadly across the collection, from my specialist area in archaeology and antiquities (especially Egyptian, of which the Powerhouse Museum has a small but select collection) all the way through to Muslim fashion, Central Asian and African textiles, historical and contemporary furniture, numismatics, ceramics and so on.I always start the day by answering emails (actually, as I’m always connected, you can often find me answering emails throughout the night as well!) before I turn my attention to the different projects I am working on (rarely, if ever, do I work on a single project at a time – but that’s what I love most about being a curator – the rich variety in what we do!).Of interest to the ‘Day of Archaeology’ is an upcoming jewellery exhibition I am working on with my colleague, Eva Czernis-Ryl, which is both a chronological and thematic look at the history of jewellery collecting in Australia. I am involved with developing the antiquities section with fellow archaeologist, Dr Paul Donnelly, and have spent the last couple of days researching the nature of ancient jewellery in the many different public and private collections, which span almost all states and territories in Australia. Right now I’m reading the exhibition catalogue to ‘Beauty and Betrayal – Ancient and Neo-Classical Jewellery’ held at the Nicholson Museum, Sydney in 2010 and am liaising with Macquarie University’s Museum of Ancient Cultures with regards to viewing some of their objects which we’d eventually like to have on loan.I’ve also been down in our basement re-looking at some of our ancient jewellery, including our Egyptian amulets, faience beaded necklaces and beautiful Roman pendant earrings. At this early stage, we’re gathering our corpus of ancient jewellery objects from which we can potentially choose from to narrate our story (note – the exhibition is not scheduled to open until October 2013). We’re most interested in details like provenance (where was the piece excavated and how did it come into the collection?), interesting stories (around ownership and use) and of course, more practical matters like condition (is it suitable for display?) and costs (since loan objects involve fees, including insurance).When I’m not ‘curating’, I’m studying for my PhD and doing other things ‘Egyptian’! My thesis topic is on the typological dating of false doors and funerary stelae of the First Intermediate Period (specifically, the reigns of Pepy II to Mentuhotep II – roughly 2400 – 2100 BC).In brief, the First Intermediate Period was the first time in Egyptian dynastic history where there was a collapse in central kingship and a shift in administration from the Memphite capital to the provinces. My reason for studying false doors and stelae (slabs of inscribed stone usually placed in the west wall of the tomb) is that they are one of the best examples of Egyptian material culture which can be traced continuously at this time, which means they potentially offer an important benchmark for dating other objects and events of the period.At this very moment, for example, I am transliterating and translating the stela of nfr-TbAw from a private French collection, one of almost 600 false doors and stelae I am working through. Apart from transliterating and translating them, I am also recording information about the owner and his/her titles, the collection location, acquisition/excavation details, bibliographic references, suggested date, commentary, parallels etc. Simultaneous to this, I am starting to test certain dating criteria on subsets of my corpus – like the writing of the Htp dj nswt offering formula as it applies to all those tomb owners holding particular groupings of titles.To top things off, I’m in the preparation stages of a fairly long visit to Egypt! In September I will be heading to Tell el-Amarna to do some cataloguing work and will be returning again in November-December to work at the South Tombs cemetery. InshAllah or “God Willing”, as they say, I am also scheduled to lead a couple of tour groups through Egypt and the Western Desert. Never a dull moment, I can truly say I’ve found my calling in archaeology!The A Day in the Life of a Curator & PhD Student From Down Under by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"600","One week as passed since the seven week fieldwork portion of an archaeology project I direct has passed, and for at least part of the day I am trying to make sense of it, and put the highlights into a report for the principal stakeholders.  The fieldwork focussed on an early 20th century Japanese camp in the forests of western Canada, and the work was undertaken primarily by those enroled in a university field school.  Those interested in the project  may want to take a look at a blog one of the students maintained. During the course of the field school, the blog had more than 3,000 hits from 20 countries, ranging alphbetically from Argentina to Zimbabwe. The blog includes daily posts, with multiple photos each day and severa video clips.The site is unique, perhaps the only of its kind in North America, with a bathhouse, gardens, considerable evidence of women, and at least several cabins (rather than a typical bunkhouse and central mess hall). The peak period of occupation was clearly as a logging camp for a few years around 1920 and was probably exclusively Japanese.  The focus of the 2012 excavations was to get a good idea about the camp layout, with a view to making it an interpretive stop along a nearby trailway, and to test the hypothesis that after its initial use as a logging camp a small group of Japanese continued to secretly occupy the camp until the early 1940s.The report I am writing includes a section on the primary objectives of the project, which include training university students in field archaeology, documenting heritage resources in this heavily-forested area, making scholarly contributions to the archaeology of logging camps and Asian-American sites, and public education about archaeology and local history.Now a heavily forested area near Vancouver, Canada, several decades ago this was a Japanese camp, with several cabins, gardens, and a bathhouse.In order to write the report, I have been reviewing the artifact catalog, about 600 pages of field notes, and student reports which include maps and analytical reports. My tentative interpretation is that there were at least several cabins located along two wooden plank roads, the site was unique insofar as it was laid out with many typical Japanse features, and that it probably did continue to be occupied secretly by Japanese from the mid 1920s to the early 1940s. I only have circumstantial evidence so far though. I hope to find evidence of a post 1920s occupation in the severa hundred artifacts collected.The Archaeology of a Japanese camp in Western Canada by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

"601","Day of Archaeology 2012 finds me completing my fourth month as an archaeological curator for the West Virginia state research and curation facility at Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex in Moundsville, WV.   The day started at 9:00 am like most others do, with a long list of emails to check and lots (and lots) of coffee.  After catching up on business, the day shifts into what I love about archaeology: processing artifacts and preserving collections.  Currently, I am in the process of analyzing and inventorying ceramics from a large multi-component site in West Virginia.  As a lab rat, the rest of my day will be spent looking at box after box of ceramics, rehousing artifacts, taking notes, drinking more coffee, researching, and entering data into an Access database.Today, I am processing ceramics; tomorrow is always a surprise.  I am thrilled to be employed in a position that not only helps protect archaeological collections for future generations, but also provides me with the opportunity to research and learn more about my field every day.    The A Day in the Life of an Archaeological Curator in West Virginia by Day of Archaeology, unless otherwise expressly stated, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
