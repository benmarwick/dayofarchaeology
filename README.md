Introduction
----
The [Day of Archaeology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Archaeology) is an event where archaeologists write about their acitivities on a [group blog](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/). The event started in 2011 and aims to 'provide a window into the daily lives of archaeologists from all over the world'. Currently there are over 1000 posts on the blog, rather a lot to read in one sitting. 

To get a quick overview of what all these archaeologists were writing about, I've generated a topic model to find the most important themes amongst the posts. By browsing the topics I can see what they key ideas are withouth having to read every word of every post. This approach is inspired by Matt Jockers' [analysis of the 2010 Day of Digital Humanities blog posts](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2010/03/19/whos-your-dh-blog-mate-match-making-the-day-of-dh-bloggers-with-topic-modeling/), and Shawn Graham, who did a similar [analysis of the 2011 Day of Archaeology blog posts](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/07/09/mining-a-day-of-archaeology/). 

Method
----
The method I've used here uses [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and a few external tools, most notably [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/). The method should be completely reproducible using the code in this repository (go ahead and try it! I recommend using R with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/)). Here's a quick summary of the process, do inspect the code for more details. 

First, I scraped the dayofarchaeology.com site to get the links to the full text of each post (because the front and subsequent pages of the main site only give a snippet of text as a teaser). Second, I pulled the full text from each post, along with the name of the author and the date. Third, I cleaned the text to remove unusual characters and formatting. Fourth, I generated a topic model using the latent Dirchlet allocation algorithm implemented MALLET (it's much faster that the pure R methods). I arbitrarily set the number of topics at 20. Fifth, I computed a similarity matrix for the authors of each post based on the mixture of topics in each author's post. Sixth, I computed a k-means cluster analysis to assign each author into a group, based on the topics detected in their post. Seventh, I visualised the groups of authors with a network graph. Each step of the method has a corresponding file in this repository.

####Here are the groups of authors. I arbitrarily set the number of groups at 20. If there is a number after the name it's because that author has more than one post on the blog...
