A Distant Reading of the Day of Archaeology
====

Introduction
----
The [Day of Archaeology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Archaeology) is an event where archaeologists write about their activities on a [group blog](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/). The event started in 2011 and aims to 'provide a window into the daily lives of archaeologists from all over the world'. Currently there are over 1000 posts on the blog, rather a lot to read in one sitting. Rather than closely read each post, we can do a distant reading to get some insights into the corpus. Distant reading is a term advocated by [Franco Moretti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Moretti) to refer to efforts to understand texts through quantitative analysis and visualisation. 

A quantitative method that has recently become [popular](http://mith.umd.edu/topic-modeling-in-the-humanities-an-overview/) for distant reading is [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model/). To get some insights into what all these archaeologists were writing about, I've generated a topic model to find the most important themes amongst the posts. By browsing the topics I can see what they key ideas are without having to read every word of every post. This approach is inspired by Matt Jockers' [analysis of the 2010 Day of Digital Humanities blog posts](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2010/03/19/whos-your-dh-blog-mate-match-making-the-day-of-dh-bloggers-with-topic-modeling/), and Shawn Graham, who did a similar [analysis of the 2011 Day of Archaeology blog posts](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/07/09/mining-a-day-of-archaeology/) and has also written an [accessible introduction to topic modelling](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet). 

The questions I'm attempting to answer with this distant reading include: what is a typical day for an archaeologist? What are the different kinds of day that are represented in this collection? Do all archaeologists have generally similar days or not? As an archaeologist also I'm curious to see how my day compares with others!

Method
----
My method uses the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) programming language and a few external tools, most notably [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/). The method should be completely reproducible using the code in this repository (go ahead and try it! If you're coming to R for the first time, I recommend using R with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/)). Here's a quick summary of the process, do inspect the code for more details. 

First, I scraped the [dayofarchaeology.com](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com) site to get the links to the full text of each post (because the front and subsequent pages of the main site only give a snippet of text as a teaser). The [blog](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com) has a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) which means we are free to copy, share and remix the blog contents, provided we give proper attribution (did I mention all of this is coming from [dayofarchaeology.com](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com)?) and make the results available with the same or similar licence (I use the [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for this repository, which is similar). Second, I pulled the full text from each post, along with the name of the author and the date. Third, I cleaned the text to remove unusual characters and formatting. Fourth, I generated a topic model using the latent Dirchlet allocation algorithm implemented MALLET (it's much faster that the pure R methods). I arbitrarily set the number of topics at 30 and generated one model with all posts from 2012-2013. Fifth, I computed a similarity matrix for the authors of each post based on the mixture of topics in each author's post. Sixth, I computed a k-means cluster analysis to assign each author into a group, based on the topics detected in their post. Seventh, I visualised the groups of authors with a network graph. Each step of the method has a corresponding file of R code in this repository. 

Results
----

I've put all the scraped data in a [csv file here](https://raw.github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology/master/data/dayofarchaeology.csv) (right-click -> save link as...) in case you want to browse or do other analyses. The csv file contains the full text of each post, the name of the author, the date of publication and the URL of the post. 

#### Summary of the corpus

In the 2012-2013 corpus there are a total of 352,558 words in 622 blog posts by 370 unique authors (as of 5pm EST 28 July 2013, a few more posts trickled in after this time, but this analysis is a weekend project, so it stops on a Sunday evening). The author count is probably an underestimate as some posts ([like this very long one](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/life-in-a-day-the-silchester-town-life-project/)) are written by multiple people using a common affiliation as the author name. There were fewer posts in 2013 (n = 273) compared to 2012 (n = 348), but the average length of the posts is slightly higher in 2013 (mean = 591) compared to 2012 (mean = 549). Here's a plot of the distribution of words per post by year:

#### Summary of the topic model

Here are 50 key words for the 30 topics generated by the LDA model:

```
It should be pretty obvious that these topics are generated by a probabilistic algorithm rather than carefully organised by a person. For example, medieval churches and Idaho in topic 22 and the cat circus in topic 7 are rather dissonant combinations. However, many of the topics seem quite distinctive and coherent, such as 4, 6, and 20. A few topics seem to make sense as mixtures or [chimera topics](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/words-alone-by-benjamin-m-schmidt/), suggesting that a slightly higher number of topics might be more appropriate. Topic 25 is like an eerily garbled telegraphic text message from an unfortunate archaeologist chained to a desk (and is similar to Graham's [topic 17](http://graeworks.net/topic-model/doa2012/Topics/Topic17.html) from 2012). Topics 28 and 30 are colophon topics dominated by the license that is attached to each post. With additional effort and time, such as analysing topic diagnostics and excluding more stopwords and non-noun parts of speech we may be able to refine the topic model. 

#### Basic validation of the model

We can validate the model to a basic degree by closely reading a tiny random sample of the corpus to see if the model's classifications seem accurate. For example, here we can see the mixture of topics in the posts by my friend and colleague [Jacq Matthews](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/author/jacquelinematthews/):

![Jacq's topics](figures/topicprops.png)

That seems pretty good, Jacq's 2012 post was about field work and her duties as an officer of the Australian Archaeological Association, while her 2013 post is more about social sciences and global cultural heritage.

And here's a graph of an interesting post by Ryan Baker on [using small aerial drones for archaeological photography, survey and model-making](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/aerial-survey-of-archaeological-excavations-using-quad-rotor-and-hex-rotor-aircraft-arch-aerial/):

![Ryan's topics](figures/topicprops2.png)

A good classification, with high proportions of topic 24 that includes models, camera, figurines and equipment and topic 27 with survey, GIS and photography.

And here we can see that [Sarah Bennett](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/author/bennetts/), an archaeologist in Florida, made quite different posts in each year:

![Sarah's topics](figures/topicprops3.png)

Sarah's 2013 post is about volunteers cleaning up a historic cemetery, which is nicely captured by topic 3. Topic 29 reflects the public volunteer aspect of the post. Sarah's 2012 post is about the excavation of a shell midden, clearly indicated by a high proportions of topic 1 and 20. Topic 20 is interesting because it seems mostly to be about the archaeology of war. We see 'shell' and 'shells' in topic 20 between the algorithm hasn't been able to distinguish between shells you eat and other kinds of shells (bombs, wrecked buildings, etc.). 

While the topic model has a few comical and naive moments, my informal and brief validation indicates that it is clearly not complete nonsense and is credible as a representation of the corpus. Note that each time you replicate the generation of this model you get slightly different topics because of the probabilistic nature of topic modelling. 

#### Visualisation of similar topics

To get a sense of relationships amongst the topics we can visualize a hierarchical clustering of topics. Here we can see that the museum topics tend to form a group distinct from the others. Excavation and field archaeology form a high-level cluster as well as regional historical archaeology topics (on the far right). The majority of topics are quite similar to each other.

![cluster of topics](figures/topiccluster.png)

#### Comparison of topics in 2012 and 2013

We can get an impression of the shift in topics from 2012 to 2013 by comparing the average proportions of each topic across all documents for each year. The five topics that are the most different are 12, 28, 6, 18 and 23. Topics 12, 23 and 28 are non-English language topics, suggesting are greater international contribution in 2013. Topic 6 seems to reflect the large number of posts in 2013 by or about archaeologists working with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.

![difference in topics](figures/topicdiffs.png)

#### Groups of similar authors

Now that we've established the credibility of the topic model, we can look at how authors group together according to the mixtures of topics in their posts. This is provided as a community service so people can discover who is writing about similar topics. 

Here are the groups of authors I get after a k-means analysis on topic proportions. I arbitrarily set the number of groups at 30 (you can run the code yourself and change the number to see what happens). With additional effort we could [algorithmically determine the optimum number of groups](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15376075/cluster-analysis-in-r-determine-the-optimal-number-of-clusters/15376462#15376462). If there is a number after the name it's because that author has more than one post on the blog. Reassuringly, most of the time we see multiple posts by the same author in the same cluster. Although we saw above that it's not always the case that one author writes about the same general mix of topics in their posts.

#### Visualisation of author groups

Here is a static visualisation of the relationship between all the authors. We get a quick sense that there are distinctive groups, but it's too small to show author names which is a major limitation.
![static visualisation](figures/static.png)

Here is a [slightly interactive visualisation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology/master/figures/d3net.html), where we can see names on the nodes (click on them to magnify the name) and inspect them in more detail by dragging them around. 

An even more interactive version can be downloaded [here](https://raw.github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology/master/figures/g.graphml) (right-click -> save link as...) and opened in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). 

Discussion and Conclusion
----
To return to the questions that motivated this little investigation, we can get some answers from what is missing from the results, as well as what is present. A reassuringly absent term is 'dinosaur', since this is often mistakenly associated with the archaeology. The last dino died out 65 million years ago, well before any people-like creatures were around (things get interesting to archaeologists around 2 million years ago). Key terms that are not prominent in the topics are pyramids, temples, whips and any kind of firearm. This suggests that a day in the life of the most popular Hollywood archaeologists has little in common with the people contributing to the day of archaeology. However, there is a small area of intersection since we see terms like 'treasure', 'gold', 'coins' and 'looting' in topic 8. This suggests that popular depictions of archaeologists as people who do things with treasure and valuable items are not completely wrong (for some lucky archaeologists, at least). We might now ask how are exactly do archaeologists get their gold, coins,  pots (the most frequently mentioned type of artefact) and other items that are less exotic but more commonly discussed during the day of archaeology? And once they've got these artefacts, what are they doing with them?

The obvious answers of survey and excavation feature prominantly in the topic model, especially topics 1 and 15. We also get some insights into other activities related to site discovery such as the use of geophysics and aerial photography. The context of site discovery and artefact recovery is frequently one where education and community engagement are priorities. For example, topic 10 inlcudes mentions of students and children, and topic 3 references learning, communities and kids. The discovery and recovery process is also quite labor intensive, especially when it comes to producing documentation. We see terms relating to documenting finds, such as forms, records and database across several topics.

Stepping away from the serious analysis of the topics for a moment, we do some simple text mining of the posts for some insights into how the fieldwork documented on the blog compares to fieldwork we seen in the movies. Here are a pair of charts that show total word counts for some words relating to fieldwork. This one shows the kinds of tools archaeologists write about. No whips or fedoras, but guns are mentioned a few times. [Closer inspection](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/?s=gun&submit=) indicates that when archaeologists write about guns, they are usually talking about them as archaeological artefacts, not as persuaders. The high frequency of mentions of computers is no doubt due to their use at all stages of archaeological activity from the field to the lab and classroom.

![tools](figures/use.png)

Next we have a chart showing a sample of things that pose dangers to archaeologists in the field. Extremes of temperature are problematic, followed by dangerous animals and dangers of falling or becoming entombed. The problem of snakes is one that is shared by real word and film archaeologists, but Nazis seem to be uniquely a Hollywood concern. Mention of aliens is because of [this post by  Serra Head](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/sometimes-you-just-have-to-debunk-it/) on her passion for public education and de-bunking stories of aliens building ancient monuments. 

![dangers](figures/fear.png)

Finally, we can mine the text to see what kinds of artefacts archaeologist typically collect during their fieldwork. Here we see that pottery is the winner, followed by other materials that are easily recognisable as raw materials for ancient food, tools and shelter. It seems that no-one took home a grail after their fieldwork, but finds of [treasure](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/?s=treasure) (or museum work on them) are quite normal, especially from the Iron Age and Roman periods. 

![things](figures/things.png)

Those three charts are of course tongue-in-cheek (and the code is in the repository so you can make your own with any combination of other tools and dangers) and quick-and-dirty (for example I've not attempted to deal with homonymy, for example by distinguishing between hot as in spicy and hot as in summer weather). However, we can clearly see a few differences between popular images of archaeologists and how archaeologists describe themselves. 

Before we put the pickaxe away, there is one more question we can address with this kind of simple text mining. What's the balance of writing about males versus females? Or who features more often in the day of archaeology, female archaeologists or male archaeologists? We can get a bit of glimpse into this by looking at counts of male and female pronouns in the blog text. Here are all the gendered pronouns (ie. excluding 'it', 'they', 'we', etc), showing females in the lead:

![all pronouns](figures/gender1.png)

And here's the aggregate view, with all the different pronouns combined by gender. This confirms it: females are nearly twice as frequently mentioned than males. With the data available from this brief analysis it's difficult to know exactly what to make of this, is it because there are more female contributors to the day of archaeology blog than males? Or are there more females doing archaeology in general? Or do archaeologists tend to attribute a female gender to objects they anthropomorphize?

![aggregate pronouns](figures/gender2.png)

Now, back to the topic model. While field activities such as excavation and survey seem prominent in the topic model, we get relatively little insight into the post-excavation analytical process. Labs are mentioned in topics 3, 24, 29, but the other terms in these topics suggest the lab work relates to conservation and preservation. Topic 26 is the exception, as it seems to be include a Neolithic faunal analysis that involves isotope analysis. This topic also notable for its negative sentiment - 'difficult', this may be one reason why relatively few people are writing about lab analyses. Another reason might be that it can be hard to know what to write about in the middle of lab work, when the interpretations are still emerging from the fog of data. Compare this to the positive sentiment elsewhere, for example topics 13, 17, 18, 22, and 3 with 'interesting', 'happy', 'fun' and 'enjoy'. We might conclude that archaeology is generally a pleasant activity, except for the lab research bits. 

The post-excavation activities that are most prominent in the topic model relate to the conversation and display of artefacts and of course writing about the artefacts and their contexts for scholarly publication and public communication. Topics 8 and 21 mention museums, collections, exhibitions and related terms, which are also scattered throughout several other topics. Terms describing artefact conservation, such as 'conservation', 'cleaning', 'fragile' and 'corrosion' are distributed across a several topics. 

But the topic model has more than just excavation, survey, sites, artefacts and museums. A related post-excavation activity that frequently appears in the topic model can be described as heritage management. This is signalled by terms such as 'heritage', 'management', 'policy', 'law', 'council', government', 'rescue', 'client' and 'commercial'. These terms are most concentrated in topic 11 as well as appearing scattered throughout other topics. This is probably an aspect of archaeology that is least expected by the general public, where archaeologists work with governments and businesses to create plans and implement methods to protect archaeological sites and artefacts and make them accessible to the public. 

A final set of activities that is unexpected in the topic model is what we might describe as the digital humanities in archaeology. Digital humanities refers to [many things](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/How_do_you_define_Humanities_Computing_/_Digital_Humanities%3F) but one broad definition is [research that uses information technology as a central part of its methodology, for creating and/or processing data](http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/Support/whatarethedh.aspx). In this topic model it is most prominently indicated by topic 4 with terms such as 'database', 'metadata', 'digital', 'open', 'access', 'image', 'video', 'text', 'app' and 'online'. On one hand, perhaps it's not surprising that people who chose to write for the day of archaeology blog are interested in digital humanities topics, since participation in blogging and social media are highly valued activities in the digital humanities. Perhaps archaeologists whose work intersects with digital humanities self-select to contribute to the day of archaeology blog, leading to over-representation in the topic model. On the other hand, we may be seeing a rising trend in the application of digital humanities approaches in archaeology (this essay is part of the trend, the text mining and topic modelling here are inspired directly by some of my favorite historians and literature scholars). Analysing next year's set of posts will help to test that idea.

To conclude, I set out to use some basic information retrieval methods to get some basic insights into what archaeologists do on a typical day (without having to closely read a vast amount of text). I downloaded all the posts on the day of archaeology blog from 2012 and 2013, generated a topic model and did some simple text mining. The results show some interesting differences and similarities between what real archaeologists do and what we see archaeologist-like characters do in Hollywood films. We've seen how fieldwork, education and community engagement are linked and widely discussed, and how mentions of lab analyses are rare. We've noted the activity of many archaeologists in conservation, curation and heritage management activities. Clearly there are a lot of archaeologists employed in these roles, which are perhaps not obvious career paths for people who graduate with a degree in archaeology (not obvious to the parents and friends of the graduates, at least). We've noted the appearance of the digital humanities in archaeology and wondered if it's an artefact of the sample or a real trend. 

I see a lot of what I expected in the results of this analysis. The activities represented in the topics are all things I tell undergraduates to expect as ways of making money and getting satisfaction from their training in archaeology. As an assistant professor of archaeology I didn't see many of my own day-to-day activities represented in the topics, there don't seem to be many academic archaeologists contributing to the day of archaeology. For the most part we are reading about the work of students and people involved in heritage management and museum projects. There are a few reasons that might explain this. First, academic archaeologists are simply much fewer in number compared to students and archaeologists working in consulting and management fields. Second, archaeologists working in heritage management might be more comfortable and willing to participate in outreach and public education projects like the day of archaeology. For academic archaeologists this may be a lower priority and a less familiar form of expression, compared to research and university teaching. Of course these are just speculations, though they might be tested with a focused survey. 

There's plenty more that could be done with a dataset like this one. For example, we could ask about what ancient time periods are most frequently written about, and what parts of the world are most represented and see how that changed between 2012 and 2013. We might ask what kinds of archaeological theories are people using when they're really doing archaeology, and how does that relate to the kind of archaeology they do. We could get a bit more sophisticated with statistics to refine the topic model and use some fancier text mining methods like named entity recognition, stylometrics, collocation analysis and sentiment analysis. All of these are fairly straightforward to implement in R, and doing so is left as an exercise to the reader (do let me know what you find!). 

As a final note, this has also been an experiement in [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research). Obviously this essay is not a highly scientific work, but it's completely open (ie. no login or subscription required). All the data and code to reproduce the results are freely available, for example on the day of archaeology blog and the code repository attached to this essay (and the software to run the code is aslo free and open source).  This approach to research is uncommon in archaeology, perhaps because of the relatively small scale of most archaeological research compared to fields where openness and reproducibility are more normal (ie. astronomy and genomics). It might be worth considering making this normal for archaeology, not least for the lowering of barriers to putting to work of archaeologists into the hands of the public, and helping them get a richer understanding of what the past was like, and how we know what it was like.
